I like finding simple ways to explain complicated stuff.
I list some of my outreach and teaching activities below.
<!-- Science is also more fun when shared!

#### Chunky exposition

- [*Why is a soap bubble like a railway?*](assets/steiner.pdf)
  (2020). Who said you couldn't minimise without calculus? A low-tech
  introduction to network planning and soap bubbles. Along the
  way, I also touch on complexity theory, physics, curvature,
  tessellations, time travel and climate change. (Ok, I'm sort of
  joking about the last two.)
- [*A hacker's guide to the Chandrasekhar limit*](https://hapax.github.io/physics/hacks/chandra/) (2020, blog
  post). A rough guide to how big a white dwarf
  (or a box of electrons) can get before it turns into a black hole.
- [*Hacking physics from the back of a napkin*](https://hapax.github.io/physics/teaching/hacks/napkin-hacks/)
  (2020, blog post) and slides [[1](assets/dim-slides.pdf),
  [2](assets/random-slides.pdf), [3](assets/brownian-slides.pdf)]. A
  paean to the processing power of the napkin. Applications include clouds, urban power usage,
  bacterial genomics, running in the rain, asteroids, and molecular motion.
- [*The Scrubland Manifesto*](https://hapax.github.io/maths/teaching/hacks/scrubland/)
  (2019, blog post). A manifesto on how to make high school math teaching fun and
  engaging.
  <!-- I illustrate with derivatives, giving both "pure math"
  highlights (including nowhere-differentiable functions and infinite
  series for Ï€) and applications (subliming spheres, self-similar
  spirals, and sandpiles). -->
- [*Dimensional analysis and black holes*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf)
(2019). An in-depth introduction to dimensional analysis, starring black hole thermodynamics.

#### Teaching and course development

<!-- From 2013--2017, I dropped a lot of math and physics at the University of
Melbourne. -->

- *An introduction to quantum computing* (TBA, University of British
  Columbia). [Various assignments](assets/big-qc.pdf) for a course
  that may or may not happen.
- [*Physical systems*](https://archive.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/phyc20014) (2016, University of Melbourne). I created tutorials on [classical mechanics]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf) and [Fourier analysis]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf) for a second-year "honours" course in physics. I also made whimsically-themed assignments about [higher-dimensional donuts]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf) and [surfing]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf)!

#### Outreach

I presented at the inaugural
[Teen Nerd Nite](https://northvan.nerdnite.com/teen-nerd-nite/), a
spinoff of
[Nerd Nite North Vancouver](https://northvan.nerdnite.com/), and am
involved in the COVID-friendly
[online version](https://teennerdnite.wordpress.com/).
Presentations:

- [*A day in the life of a theoretical physicist*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brS_7DUmFRk)
(2020). A brief video about my path to physics and what a day in the
life of a theorist looks like.
- [*Black holes and the information paradox*](assets/tnn.pdf)
  (2020). What happens if you drop your homework into a black hole?
  We can experiment using bits and buckets.

The [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/)
  is an outreach program for high school students in the Vancouver
  area. I was a volunteer in 2018 and coordinated from 2019--20. Here
  are a few of the things I got up to:
<!-- - *The Hacker's Guide to Physics* [[1](assets/dim-slides.pdf),
  [2](assets/random-slides.pdf), [3](assets/brownian-slides.pdf)] (2020). A series of lectures
  covering dimensional analysis,
  random walks, and Brownian motion, ending with a DIY calculation of
  Avogadro's number. Based on aforementioned
  [blog post](https://hapax.github.io/physics/teaching/hacks/napkin-hacks/). -->
- [*Physics Circle: problems and solutions*](assets/circle-probs.pdf)
(2018--19). A medley of problems on everything from string theory to Starbucks.
- *Assorted scrappy notes* (2019--20). Unpolished notes on various
topics.
  - [**Fermi estimates: from Harry Potter to ET**](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf). How
    to estimate just about anything!
  - [**Black hole mergers**](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf). Colliding
    black holes and gravitational waves.
  - [**Searching for aliens**]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf). Fast
  radio bursts and extraterrestrials.
  
<!-- I wrote and conducted tutorials for a second year course on classical mechanics and Fourier analysis. Stuff I wrote: [*Classical mechanics tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf). Lagrangian and a dash of Hamiltonian mechanics. [*Fourier analysis tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and optics. *Assignments*  [[1]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf),  [2]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf)]. Higher-dimensional  donuts and surfing.-->
<!-- [*Real analysis*](https://archive.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/mast20026)
     (2013--16). An intro to proofs and real analysis. My [extra problems]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ra-problems.pdf)!
<!-- Other subjects taught:
     [*Quantum field theory*](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2017/subjects/phyc90008)
     (2017). [*Vector calculus*](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2017/subjects/mast20009)
     (2017). [*Group theory and linear algebra*](http://archive.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/mast20022/)

     (2014). -->

<!-- - *Real analysis* (2014). I was head tutor for an [introductory real analysis subject](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast20026), and wrote a [few extension problems]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ra-problems.pdf) during my tenure. - -->
<!-- [*Einstein's bottomless beanbag*](assets/conceptual-gravity.pdf) -->
<!-- (2019). Look ma, no equations! A conceptual introduction to -->
<!-- gravity and black holes for interested laypeople. - -->
<!-- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{ -->
<!-- hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A long problem set -->
<!-- on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli* -->
<!-- bacterium. -->

<!-- - [*Colliding black holes*](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf) and   [*ET phone home*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf) (2020). Material for
  open-ended discussions on black hole collisions and alien signals. -->
<!-- - [*Fermi estimates: from Harry Potter to ET*](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf) (2019). A user's guide to

  computer storage, the length of the Harry Potter novels, and the number
  of aliens in the galaxy. Rough draft. -->
