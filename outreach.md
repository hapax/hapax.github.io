- *UBC Physics Circle* (2018--20). I co-run the
  [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/),
  an outreach program for high school students in the
  Vancouver area.
A few things I've written:
<!-- - [*Colliding black holes*](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf) and   [*ET phone home*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf) (2020). Material for
  open-ended discussions on black hole collisions and alien signals. -->
<!-- - [*Fermi estimates: from Harry Potter to ET*](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf) (2019). A user's guide to
  order-of-magnitude estimates. Examples along the way include global
  computer storage, the length of the Harry Potter novels, and the number
  of aliens in the galaxy. Rough draft. -->
  - [*Dimensional analysis and black holes*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf) (2019). An
  introduction to dimensional analysis, with applications to
  fundamental constants, natural units, and black holes.
  - [*Physics Circle: problems and solutions*](assets/circle-probs.pdf)
  (2018--19). A medley of problems on everything from string theory to
  Starbucks. Requires a strong background in high school physics and maths.
- *Physical systems* (2016). I wrote the tutorials
  ([*1*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf),
  [*2*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf)) for a
  [second year course](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/phyc20014)
  on classical mechanics and Fourier analysis.
  <!--  -[*Classical mechanics tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf). Lagrangian and a little Hamiltonian mechanics. - [*Fourier analysis tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and optics. -->
  <!--  -
  [*Assignment 2*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf). Velocity
  filters and higher-dimensional donuts. -
  [*Assignment 3*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf). Fourier
  analysis at the beach. -->
- *Real analysis* (2014--15). I was head tutor for an
  [introductory real analysis subject](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast20026). [Extension problems]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ra-problems.pdf).

[//]: #- Other subjects taught (all at the University of Melbourne):
[//]: #  - *Quantum field theory* (2017)
[//]: #  - *Vector calculus* (2017)
[//]: #  - *Group theory and linear algebra* (2016)
[//]: #  - *Real analysis* (2013--2016)
[//]: #  - *Linear algebra* (2013)

<!-- - *Real analysis* (2014). I was head tutor for an [introductory real analysis subject](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast20026), and wrote a [few extension problems]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ra-problems.pdf) during my tenure. - -->
<!-- [*Einstein's bottomless beanbag*](assets/conceptual-gravity.pdf) -->
<!-- (2019). Look ma, no equations! A conceptual introduction to -->
<!-- gravity and black holes for interested laypeople. - -->
<!-- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{ -->
<!-- hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A long problem set -->
<!-- on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli* -->
<!-- bacterium. -->
