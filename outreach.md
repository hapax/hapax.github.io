- [*The Penrose singularity theorem*](assets/singularity.pdf)
  (2020). A short introduction to general relativity and singularities for
  high school students. Now with [exercises](assets/sing-problems.pdf) and a [lay summary](assets/penrose.pdf).
- [*Why is a soap bubble like a railway?*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09611.pdf)
  (2020). Who said you couldn't minimise without calculus? A low-tech
  introduction to network planning and soap bubbles. Along the
  way, I also touch on complexity theory, physics, curvature,
  tessellations, time travel and climate change. (Ok, I'm sort of
  joking about the last two.)
