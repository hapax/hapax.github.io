### Outreach

- [*Dimensional analysis and black holes*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf)
  (2019). Talk for the [UBC Metro Vancouver Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/).
- [*Physics circle problems*](assets/circle-probs.pdf)
  (2018--19). Problems contributed to the Physics Circle. This list is
  still under development.

### Teaching

- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A short problem set
  on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli*
  bacterium.
- [*Problems in classical mechanics*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf) (2016). Tutorials
  on classical mechanics for a
  [second year physics course](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/phyc20014)
  at the University of Melbourne.
- [*Problems in Fourier analysis*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf) (2016). Tutorials
  on wave mechanics and Fourier analysis for the same subject. I also wrote two assignments: one on
  [higher-dimensional donuts]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf),
  and another on
  [Fourier analysis at the beach]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf).
