#### Outreach

- [*Counternarratives for young scientists*](https://hapax.github.io/assets/reality) (2020). A
  short address given at Quantum Leaps, a
  STEAM-oriented conference for Vancouver high school students.
- [*The hole in Einstein's theory*](assets/penrose.pdf) (2020). A short
  lay summary of the Penrose singularity theorem.
- [*A day in the life of a theoretical physicist*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brS_7DUmFRk)
(2020). A video for Vancouver's
[Teen Nerd Nite](https://teennerdnite.wordpress.com/) about my path to
physics and what a day in the life looks like.
- [*Black holes and the information paradox*](assets/tnn.pdf)
  (2020). What happens if you drop your homework into a black hole?
  An experiment using bits and buckets, carried out at the inaugural
  Teen Nerd Nite.

#### "Hard" outreach

- [*Quantum computing with parallel worlds*](assets/tnn-qc.pdf)
  (2021). A very brief introduction to manipulating parallel worlds
  with quantum computers. Bonus feature: a visual introduction to Grover search!
- [*Black holes and quantum computers*](assets/bh-qc.pdf)
  (2021). A guest lecture on the information paradox and Page
  curve for high school students in the
  [Quantum BC masterclass](http://quantum-bc.ca/learn/diversifying-talent-in-quantum-computing/programming/masterclass/). You
  can find code for simulating black holes and making your own
  Page curve [here](assets/black-hole-simulator.py).
- [*The Penrose singularity theorem*](assets/singularity.pdf)
  (2020). A short introduction to general relativity and singularities for
  the [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/). Now
  with [exercises](assets/sing-problems.pdf).
- [*Why is a soap bubble like a railway?*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09611.pdf)
  (2020). Who said you couldn't minimise without calculus? A low-tech
  intro to network planning and soap bubbles. I also touch on complexity theory, physics, curvature,
  tessellations, time travel and climate change.
- [*A hacker's guide to the Chandrasekhar limit*](https://hapax.github.io/physics/hacks/chandra/)
  (2020). A long blog post on how big a white dwarf
  (or a box of electrons) can get before it turns into a black hole.
- [*Hacking physics from the back of a napkin*](https://hapax.github.io/physics/teaching/hacks/napkin-hacks/) (2020). A
  long blog post on napkin algorithms, later converted into more
  polished Physics Circle lectures on [dimensional analysis](assets/dim-slides.pdf),
  [random walks](assets/random-slides.pdf), and
  [Brownian motion](assets/brownian-slides.pdf).
- [*Black hole mergers*](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf) (2020). Notes for
    an open-ended Physics Circle discussion of colliding black holes and LIGO.
- [*Searching for aliens*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf)
  (2020). Notes for a Physics Circle discussion of fast
  radio bursts, signals, and extraterrestrials.
- [*The Scrubland Manifesto*](https://hapax.github.io/maths/teaching/hacks/scrubland/)
  (2019). A blogifesto controversially asserting that high
  school math should be fun, useful and engaging. Examples included.
- [*Fermi estimates: from Harry Potter to ET*](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf) (2019). A
	Physics Circle talk on how to estimate just about anything,
	from the amount of computer storage in the world to the loonies concealed in couches across Canada.
- [*Dimensional analysis and black holes*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf)
    (2019). A tutorial on dimensional analysis for the UBC
    Physics Circle, paying off in black hole thermodynamics.
- [*Physics Circle problems*](assets/circle-probs.pdf) (2018--19). A medley of problems on everything from string theory to Starbucks.

#### Teaching and course development

- [*A visual approach to the quantum Fourier transform*](https://hapax.github.io/assets/visual-qft)
  (2020). An elementary, geometric approach to representing vectors in
  higher-dimensional spaces, paying off in the quantum Fourier transform.
- [*An introduction to quantum computing*](assets/big-qc.pdf) (2020).
  Various assignments for a graduate
  course in the works at UBC.
- [*Physical systems*](https://archive.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/phyc20014)
  (2016). Tutorials on [classical mechanics]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf)
  and
  [Fourier analysis]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). Assignments
  on [higher-dimensional donuts]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf) and [surfing]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf).
