I think science is a great way to get to know the world, and a
beautiful thing to share!
I list some of my outreach and teaching efforts below.

- *The Hacker's Guide to Physics* (2020). A short series of zoom
lectures for students in the UBC Physics Circle, cover
[dimensional analysis](assets/dim-slides.pdf),
[random walks and collisions](assets/random-slides.pdf), and [Brownian motion](assets/brownian-slides.pdf).
- *UBC Physics Circle* (2018--20). I coordinated the
  [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/),
  an outreach program for high school students in the Vancouver
  area. Here are a few of the crazy things we got up to.
  - [*Dimensional analysis and black holes*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf)
  (2019). An introduction to dimensional analysis, with applications to black
  holes.
  - [*Physics Circle: problems and solutions*](assets/circle-probs.pdf)
  (2018--19). A medley of problems on everything from string theory to
  Starbucks.
  - *Scrappy notes*. Assorted notes on [Fermi estimates](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf), [colliding black holes](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf),
  and [talking to aliens]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf).



<!-- - [*Colliding black holes*](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf) and   [*ET phone home*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf) (2020). Material for
  open-ended discussions on black hole collisions and alien signals. -->
<!-- - [*Fermi estimates: from Harry Potter to ET*](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf) (2019). A user's guide to
  order-of-magnitude estimates. Examples along the way include global
  computer storage, the length of the Harry Potter novels, and the number
  of aliens in the galaxy. Rough draft. -->
<!-- - *Physical systems* (2016). I wrote and conducted tutorials
  for a [second year course](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/phyc20014)
  on [*classical mechanics*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf)
  and
  [*Fourier analysis*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). -->
  <!--  -[*Classical mechanics tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf). Lagrangian and a little Hamiltonian mechanics. - [*Fourier analysis tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and optics. -->
  <!--  -
  [*Assignment 2*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf). Velocity
  filters and higher-dimensional donuts. -
  [*Assignment 3*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf). Fourier
  analysis at the beach. -->
<!-- - *Real analysis* (2014--15). I was head tutor for an
  [introductory real analysis subject](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast20026),
  and wrote some
  [*extension problems*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ra-problems.pdf)
  during my time. --> 
<!-- [//]: #- Other subjects taught (all at the University of
  Melbourne): -->
<!--[//]: #  - *Quantum field theory* (2017) -->
<!--[//]: #  - *Vector calculus* (2017) -->
<!--[//]: #  - *Group theory and linear algebra* (2016) -->
<!--[//]: #  - *Real analysis* (2013--2016) -->
<!--[//]: #  - *Linear algebra* (2013) -->

<!-- - *Real analysis* (2014). I was head tutor for an [introductory real analysis subject](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast20026), and wrote a [few extension problems]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ra-problems.pdf) during my tenure. - -->
<!-- [*Einstein's bottomless beanbag*](assets/conceptual-gravity.pdf) -->
<!-- (2019). Look ma, no equations! A conceptual introduction to -->
<!-- gravity and black holes for interested laypeople. - -->
<!-- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{ -->
<!-- hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A long problem set -->
<!-- on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli* -->
<!-- bacterium. -->
