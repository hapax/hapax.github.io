### UBC Physics Circle

I co-run the
  [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/),
  an outreach program for high school students in the
  Vancouver area.
  Email me if you'd like to get involved!

Some of the material I've written for the circle:

<!-- - [*Colliding black holes*](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf) and   [*ET phone home*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf) (2020). Material for
  open-ended discussions on black hole collisions and alien signals. -->
<!-- - [*Fermi estimates: from Harry Potter to ET*](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf) (2019). A user's guide to
  order-of-magnitude estimates. Examples along the way include global
  computer storage, the length of the Harry Potter novels, and the number
  of aliens in the galaxy. Rough draft. -->
- [*Dimensional analysis and black holes*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf) (2019). An
  introduction to dimensional analysis, with applications to
  fundamental constants, natural units, and black holes.
- [*Physics Circle: problems and solutions*](assets/circle-probs.pdf)
  (2018--19). A medley of problems on everything from string theory to
  Starbucks. Requires only high school physics and a strong constitution.

### Other outreach

- [*Entanglement and quantum secrecy*](assets/2017-06-16-entanglement.md)
  (2017). An introduction to quantum mechanics and quantum key
  distribution, given at the
  [Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/The-Melbourne-Maths-and-Science-Meetup/).
- [*Quantum computing in flatland*](assets/2016-05-03-quasi-qcomp.md)
  (2016). How to build quantum computers with
  quasiparticles, i.e. particles which are neither bosons nor
  fermions. A talk to undergraduates at the University of Melbourne.
- [*Black hole thermodynamics*](assets/2015-08-31-bh-thermo.md) (2015).
  Black holes ain't so different from a hot box of gas. A talk to
  undergraduates at the University of Melbourne.

### Teaching

- *Physical systems* (2016). A
  [second year course](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/phyc20014)
  on wave mechanics and Fourier analysis. I wrote the tutorials and
  assessment below.
  - [*Classical mechanics tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf). Lagrangian
  and a little Hamiltonian mechanics.
  - [*Fourier analysis tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and optics.
  - [*Assignment 2*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf). Velocity filters and higher-dimensional donuts.
  - [*Assignment 3*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf). Fourier analysis at the beach.

<!-- - *Real analysis* (2014). I was head tutor for an [introductory real analysis subject](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast20026), and wrote a [few extension problems]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ra-problems.pdf) during my tenure. - -->
<!-- [*Einstein's bottomless beanbag*](assets/conceptual-gravity.pdf) -->
<!-- (2019). Look ma, no equations! A conceptual introduction to -->
<!-- gravity and black holes for interested laypeople. - -->
<!-- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{ -->
<!-- hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A long problem set -->
<!-- on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli* -->
<!-- bacterium. -->
