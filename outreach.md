Science should be fun and empowering.
From lay outreach to undergraduate teaching, I love to get people
excited about ideas in maths and physics. I also like to give them
tools they can use to solve real problems!

### UBC Physics circle

I co-run the
  [UBC physics circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/),
  an outreach program for talented high school students in the
  Vancouver area.
  
- *Fermi estimates Harry Potter to ET (talk)*. A user's guide to
  order-of-magnitude estimates. The payoff: a (kind of) solution to Fermi's
  paradox with Fermi estimates!
- [*Dimensional analysis (talk)*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf). An
  introduction to dimensional analysis, with applications to
  fundamental constants, natural units, and black holes.
- [*Circle problems*](assets/circle-probs.pdf). Some of my problem
    session contributions.

### Other outreach

- [*Einstein's bottomless beanbag*](assets/conceptual-gravity.pdf) (2019). Look ma, no equations! A conceptual introduction to
  gravity and black holes for interested laypeople.
- [*Quizzics*](assets/quzzics.pdf) (2019). Multiple choice questions
  contributed to the UBC high school [Physics Olympics](https://physoly.phas.ubc.ca/). Some of my problems featured in a local
  [newspaper article](https://thetyee.ca/Culture/2019/03/13/Physics-Olympics-Spectating/)
  on the event!
- [*Entanglement and quantum secrecy*](assets/2017-06-16-entanglement.md)
  (2017). A presentation given at the [Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/The-Melbourne-Maths-and-Science-Meetup/).
- [*Quantum computing in flatland*](assets/2016-05-03-quasi-qcomp.md)
  (2016). A talk to undergraduates at Melbourne uni.
- [*Black hole thermodynamics*](assets/2015-08-31-bh-thermo) (2015). A
  talk to undergraduates at Melbourne uni.

### Teaching

- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A long problem set
  on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli*
  bacterium.
- *Physical systems* (2016). A
  [second year course](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/phyc20014)
  on wave mechanics and Fourier analysis. I wrote the tutorials and
  some of the assessment, see below.
  - [*Classical mechanics tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf). Lagrangian
  and a little Hamiltonian mechanics.
  - [*Fourier analysis tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and optics.
  - [*Assignment 2*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf). Velocity filters and higher-dimensional donuts.
  - [*Assignment 3*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf). Fourier analysis at the beach.
