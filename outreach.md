### Outreach

- [Metro Vancouver Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/)
  (2018--19). A program where high school students visit UBC, hear a
  physics talk, and do some competition-style problems. I've given a
  talk, and frequently contribute problems.
  - [*Dimensional analysis (talk)*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf). With
  application to fundamental constants and black holes.
  - [*Physics circle problems*](assets/circle-probs.pdf). Ongoing!

### Teaching

- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A short problem set
  on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli*
  bacterium.
- [*Physical systems*](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/phyc20014)
  (2016). A second year course on wave mechanics and Fourier
  analysis. I wrote the tutorials and some of the assessment, see below.
  - [*Classical mechanics tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf). Lagrangian
  mechanics, rotation, and a little Hamiltonian mechanics.
  - [*Fourier analysis tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). Fourier
  -series, transforms, and optics.
  - [*Assignment 2: Velocity filters and higher-dimensional donuts*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf).
  - [*Assignment 3: Fourier analysis at the beach*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf).
