#### Outreach

- [*The Penrose singularity theorem*](assets/singularity.pdf)
  (2020). A short introduction to general relativity and singularities for
  the [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/). Now
  with [exercises](assets/sing-problems.pdf)
  and a [lay summary](assets/penrose.pdf).
- [*A day in the life of a theoretical physicist*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brS_7DUmFRk)
(2020). A video for Vancouver's
[Teen Nerd Nite](https://teennerdnite.wordpress.com/) about my path to
physics and what a day in the life looks like.
- [*Why is a soap bubble like a railway?*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09611.pdf)
  (2020). Who said you couldn't minimise without calculus? A low-tech
  intro to network planning and soap bubbles. I also touch on complexity theory, physics, curvature,
  tessellations, time travel and climate change.
- [*Black holes and the information paradox*](assets/tnn.pdf)
  (2020). What happens if you drop your homework into a black hole?
  An experiment using bits and buckets, carried out at the inaugural
  Teen Nerd Nite.
- [*A hacker's guide to the Chandrasekhar limit*](https://hapax.github.io/physics/hacks/chandra/) (2020). A rough guide to how big a white dwarf
  (or a box of electrons) can get before it turns into a black hole.
- *The hacker's guide to physics* (2020). A lecture series for
  UBC Physics Circle covering [dimensional analysis](assets/dim-slides.pdf),
  [random walks](assets/random-slides.pdf), and
  [Brownian motion](assets/brownian-slides.pdf). Based on a
  [blog post](https://hapax.github.io/physics/teaching/hacks/napkin-hacks/).
- [*Black hole mergers*](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf). Note for
    an open-ended Physics Circle discussion of colliding black holes and LIGO.
- [*Searching for aliens*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf)
  (2020). Notes for an open-ended Physics Circle discussion of fast radio bursts and
  extraterrestrials.
- [*The Scrubland Manifesto*](https://hapax.github.io/maths/teaching/hacks/scrubland/)
  (2019). A manifesto controversially asserting that high
  school math should be fun, useful and engaging. Examples included.
- [*Physics Circle problems*](assets/circle-probs.pdf)
(2018--19). A medley of problems on everything from string theory to Starbucks.
- [*Fermi estimates: from Harry Potter to ET*](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf). A
	Physics Circle talk on how to estimate just about anything,
	from the amount of computer storage in the world to the loonies concealed in couches across Canada.
- [*Dimensional analysis and black holes*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf)
    (2019). A tutorial on dimensional analysis for the UBC
    Physics Circle, paying off in black hole thermodynamics.

#### Teaching and course development

- *An introduction to quantum computing* (2020, University of British
  Columbia). [Various assignments](assets/big-qc.pdf) for a graduate
  course which is in the works.
- [*Physical systems*](https://archive.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/phyc20014)
  (2016, University of Melbourne). I created tutorials on
  [classical mechanics]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf)
  and
  [Fourier analysis]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf)
  for a second-year honours course in physics. I also wrote assignments on [higher-dimensional donuts]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf) and [surfing]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf).
