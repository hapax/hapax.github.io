I like finding new and simple ways to explain complicated stuff.
Science is also more fun when shared!
I list some of my teaching and outreach activities below.

#### Expository papers

- [*Why is a soap bubble like a railway?*](assets/steiner.pdf)
  (2020). A low-tech introduction to Steiner trees and soap bubbles,
  requiring only pre-calculus maths. Draft version.
- [*Hacking physics from the back of a napkin*](https://hapax.github.io/physics/teaching/hacks/napkin-hacks/)
  (2020, blog post). A paean to the computational power of the humble
  napkin, and its pedagogical possibilities.
- [*The Scrubland Manifesto*](https://hapax.github.io/maths/teaching/hacks/scrubland/)
  (2019, blog post). A manifesto on how to make math teaching fun and
  engaging, applied to derivatives.

#### Outreach

I recently gave a talk at the inaugural
[Teen Nerd Nite](https://northvan.nerdnite.com/teen-nerd-nite/), a
spinoff of
[Nerd Nite North Vancouver](https://northvan.nerdnite.com/). It was
awesome! My slides are below.

- [*Black holes and information paradox*](assets/tnn.pdf)
  (2020). What happens to information that falls into a black hole?

The [UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/)
  is an outreach program for high school students in the Vancouver
  area. I was a volunteer in 2018 and coordinated from 2019--20. Here
  are a few of the crazy things I got up to!
- *The Hacker's Guide to Physics* (2020). A series of lectures
  covering [dimensional analysis](assets/dim-slides.pdf),
  [random walks](assets/random-slides.pdf), and
  [Brownian motion](assets/brownian-slides.pdf). Based on aforementioned
  [blog post](https://hapax.github.io/physics/teaching/hacks/napkin-hacks/).
- [*Physics Circle: problems and solutions*](assets/circle-probs.pdf)
(2018--19). A medley of problems on everything from string theory to
sneezing cubesats into space.
- [*Dimensional analysis and black holes*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf)
(2019). An in-depth introduction to dimensional analysis, with
applications to black hole thermodynamics.
- *Assorted scrappy notes* (2019--20). Unpolished notes on various topics.
  - [Black hole mergers](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf). Colliding
    black holes and gravitational waves.
  - [Searching for aliens]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf). Fast
    radio bursts and extraterrestrials.
  - [Fermi estimates: from Harry Potter to ET](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf). How
    to estimate just about anything!

#### Teaching

From 2013--2017, I dropped a lot of math and physics at the University of
Melbourne.

- [*Physical systems*](https://archive.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/phyc20014) (2016). I wrote and conducted tutorials for a second year course
  on classical mechanics and Fourier analysis. Stuff I wrote:
   - [*Classical mechanics tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf). Lagrangian and a little Hamiltonian mechanics.
   - [*Fourier analysis tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and optics.
   - *Assignments*. [Higher-dimensional donuts]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf)
     and [Fourier analysis for surfers]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf).
- [*Real analysis*](https://archive.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/mast20026)
     (2013--16). An intro to proofs and real analysis. My
     [extra problems]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ra-problems.pdf)!
- Other subjects taught:
   - [*Quantum field theory*](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2017/subjects/phyc90008) (2017).
   - [*Vector calculus*](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2017/subjects/mast20009) (2017).
   - [*Group theory and linear algebra*](http://archive.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2016/mast20022/) (2016).
   - [*Linear algebra*](http://archive.handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2014/mast10007/) (2014).

<!-- - *Real analysis* (2014). I was head tutor for an [introductory real analysis subject](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/mast20026), and wrote a [few extension problems]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/ra-problems.pdf) during my tenure. - -->
<!-- [*Einstein's bottomless beanbag*](assets/conceptual-gravity.pdf) -->
<!-- (2019). Look ma, no equations! A conceptual introduction to -->
<!-- gravity and black holes for interested laypeople. - -->
<!-- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{ -->
<!-- hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A long problem set -->
<!-- on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli* -->
<!-- bacterium. -->

<!-- - [*Colliding black holes*](assets/colliding-black-holes.pdf) and   [*ET phone home*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/ET-phone-home.pdf) (2020). Material for
  open-ended discussions on black hole collisions and alien signals. -->
<!-- - [*Fermi estimates: from Harry Potter to ET*](assets/fermi-estimates.pdf) (2019). A user's guide to
  order-of-magnitude estimates. Examples along the way include global
  computer storage, the length of the Harry Potter novels, and the number
  of aliens in the galaxy. Rough draft. -->
