### Outreach

- [*Einstein's bottomless beanbag*](assets/conceptual-gravity.pdf) (2019). A conceptual introduction to
  gravity and black holes.
- [*Metro Vancouver Physics Circle*](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/)
  (2018--19). An outreach program for high school students, run
  through UBC. I write problems, help run sessions, and occasionally
  give talks.
  - [*Dimensional analysis (talk)*](assets/dimensional-analysis.pdf). A
  gentle introduction to dimensional analysis, with applications to
  the heady physics of black holes.
  - [*Circle problems*](assets/circle-probs.pdf). A selection of
    questions I've contributed to the problem sessions.

### Teaching

- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A short problem set
  on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli*
  bacterium.
- [*Physical systems*](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/phyc20014)
  (2016). A second year course on wave mechanics and Fourier
  analysis. I wrote the tutorials and some of the assessment, see below.
  - [*Classical mechanics tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf). Lagrangian
  and a little Hamiltonian mechanics.
  - [*Fourier analysis tutorials*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf). Fourier series, Fourier transforms, and optics.
  - [*Assignment 2*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf). Velocity filters and higher-dimensional donuts.
  - [*Assignment 3*]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf). Fourier analysis at the beach.
- Other subjects taught (all at the University of Melbourne):
  - *Quantum field theory* (2017)
  - *Vector calculus* (2017)
  - *Group theory and linear algebra* (2016)
  - *Real analysis* (2013--2016)
  - *Linear algebra* (2013)
