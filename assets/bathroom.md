**December13, 2029.** *A short, equation-free post on two bathroom
  phenomena with surprising physical explanations: the shadow cast by hair on water, and the tendency of
  shower curtains to billow out during use.*

#### A follicular folly

Place a human hair on a body of water in a well-lit bathroom.
Any part of the hair which pierces the water will cast an ordinary geometric shadow.
But any part that floats on the surface will cast a strangely large
shadow, surrounded by bright fringes.
I decided to investigate after my brother asked me why it happens.

The short answer is surface tension.
The molecules at the surface of the water are more strongly attracted
to each other than the molecules in the middle, since they have
nothing to attach to above.
So they form a sort of elastic membrane on which the hair can sit.
Often, the explanations of how surface tension works are confusing
and wrong.
If the membrane is unbroken, how can it pull on an object?
Basically, it's a spring, and stretching it will produce a restoring
force along the spring.
This can generate an upwards force on the object if it sits in a dip,
as the angled arrows indicate below left.

But when we displace water, as in this dip, buoyancy forces due to the
weight of displaced water trying to push its way back also play a
role.
They provide an upward force, also shown above left.
The force due to buoyancy is the volume of the hair beneath the water
level (the dotted line above right).
But we have displaced some extra water, shown in purple, and this
turns out to precisely equal the effects of surface tension.
In other words,

The force on an object supported by surface tension is the weight of displaced water.

Now we can explain the odd shadow.
The dip creates a concave lens which makes the light diverge, leading
to a larger shadow.
To return to a flat, level surface, it must undo some of the concave
curvature with some convex curvature at the edges.
This is what causes the bright fringe for the larger shadow.
We draw a cartoon below, with edges of the concave and convex sections
represented by dots:

But this isn't the end of the story. I noticed that if I dipped one
end of the hair into the water, and let it emerge, I got a very
peculiar shadow I call a "jellyfish":
