**December13, 2029.** *A short post on two fun forms of bathroom
  physics: the shadow cast by hair on water, and the tendency of
  shower curtains to billow out during use.*

#### A follicular folly

Place a human hair on a body of water in a well-lit bathroom.
Any part of the hair which pierces the water will cast an ordinary geometric shadow.
But any part that floats on the surface will cast a strangely large
shadow, surrounded by bright fringes.
I decided to investigate after my brother asked me why it happens.

The short answer is surface tension.
The molecules at the surface of the water are more strongly attracted
to each other than the molecules in the middle, since they have
nothing to attach to above.
So they form a sort of elastic membrane on which the hair can sit.
Often, the explanations of how surface tension works are confusing
and wrong.
If the membrane is unbroken, how can it pull on an object?
Basically, it's a spring, and stretching it will produce a restoring
force along the spring.
This can generate an upwards force on the object if it sits in a dip,
as the angled arrows indicate below.
