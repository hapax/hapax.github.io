**December13, 2029.** *A short post on two physical phenomena I have observed
  in the bathroom: the shadow cast by hair on water, and the tendency
  of shower curtains to billow out during use.*

#### A follicular folly

Place a human hair on a body of water in a well-lit bathroom.
Any part of the hair which pierces the water will cast an ordinary geometric shadow.
But any part that floats on the surface will cast a strangely large
shadow, surrounded by bright fringes.
My brother asked me why this happens, so I decided to investigate.

#### Drawing the curtain
