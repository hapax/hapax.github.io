## 1. Introduction <a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Suppose we want to join up three towns ($A$, $B$ and $C$) by rail.
If I can use this railway to travel from one town to any
other, we say that rail network is *connected*.
Two simple examples of connected networks are shown below.

    trident) connecting three towns.</i></figcaption>

Building railways is expensive, since we not only need to design and
build the rail itself, but acquire the land beneath it.
In contrast, stations are cheap: we just slap together some sidings, a
platform, and a bench or two, and we're done.
If we want to minimise cost, we should therefore make the total length
of the rail network as short as possible, adding extra stations if they
assist us in this goal.
The resulting layout is called the *minimal network* connecting $A$, $B$ and $C$.

We can consider the same problem for $n$ stations, and seek rail
networks of smallest total length.
Although finding the exact solution is difficult in
general, we can use simple reasoning to learn some important features
of the connectivity and layout of these minimal networks.

---

*Exercise 1 (choosing sides).* Suppose $A$, $B$ and $C$ are separated
by distances $AB = c$, $AC = b$ and $BC = a$.
A triangular network consists of two sides of the triangle.
Which ones should we choose?

*Exercise 2 (triangle or trident).* In Figure 1, we have two networks connecting the same towns: a triangular network,
and a trident-shaped network with a hub station $D$ in the middle.
Which is shorter?
See if you can do better than either.

*Hint.* Measure lengths on the screen with a ruler. You may
 feel like your grandparents, but it works!

---

## 2. Triangles <a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

The three-town problem is already surprising.
The simplest possibility is the triangular network, but it is not
minimal; to minimise length, a trident-shaped network with a new
station $D$ is optimal.
The best place to put the hub station is called the *Fermat point*, and if you are keen, you can learn how to
determine this point in the <a href="#sec-A">appendix</a>.
But for the rest of the post, we will only worry about *when* we
should build a hub, rather than *where* it goes exactly.
This will save us some hard trigonometry!
Our first and only exception will be an important special case: the
equilateral triangle.

### 2.1. Equilateral triangles <a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a>

So, imagine that the towns $A$, $B$ and $C$ are now equally spaced,
and sit on the corners of an equilateral triangle of side length $d$.
The triangular network has total length $L_\Delta = 2d$.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner2.png" width="80%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 2. Rail networks on an equilateral triangle.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

We might imagine that a trident network with a station in the middle
does better, but instead of checking with a ruler, let's do a little
trigonometry.

---

*Exercise 3 (equilateral trident).* Show that the length of the
trident network, with a hub in the centre of the triangle, is

$$
L_{\text{Y}} = \sqrt{3}d.
$$

Since $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.7 < 2$, the trident is indeed shorter
than the triangle.

---

We are going to argue not only that the trident network is better than
the triangle network, but that the best place to put the hub station
$D$ is right in the centre, using a simple line of symmetry-based reasoning.
Let's place $D$ anywhere we like, but now draw one of the *axes of
symmetry* of the triangle, represented by the red line in Figure 3.
We are going to move the hub side to side in a normal direction to the
axis of symmetry, drawn as a dark blue line in Figure 3.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner3.png" width="40%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 3. Wiggling the hub around an axis
    of symmetry.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

As we wiggle the hub left or right of the axis, the total length of
the network (the lengths of the light blue legs) will change.
But symmetry places strong constraints on how it changes.
If we shift $D$ a distance $x$ to the left of the axis, this
should give exactly the length as shifting to the right by $x$, since
the triangle is left-right symmetric around the red line.
Thus, the function is *even*, with $L(x) = L(-x)$, where $x$ is the
shift away from the axis, with $x < 0$ to the left and $x > 0$ to the
right.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner4.png" width="35%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 4. Length as a function of wiggle
    $x$ away from the axis.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

In Figure 4, we have drawn two possibilities for an even length
function $L(x)$.
It can either be a *minimum* at the point of symmetry $x = 0$, or a
*maximum*. A function which is even around $x= 0$ has no other choice!
But it's clear from Figure 5 that if we make $x$ very large, the
length will get very large as well.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner5.png" width="70%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 5. The trident gets long for large $x$.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

This suggests that $L$ is a *minimum* and not a *maximum* at $x=
0$, so the top graph in Figure 4 is the correct one.
If it was a maximum, then length would get smaller at large $x$!

---

*Exercise 4 (exact length).* Although this argument is plausible,
 it doesn't rule out the possibility that $x=0$ is actually a maximum,
 with the true minimum at some symmetrically spaced points $\pm
 x_\text{min}$, before length increases again as $|x|$ gets larger.
 If you are worried, you can calculate the length exactly and check!

    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner6.png" width="35%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 6. Calculating the exact network length.</i></figcaption>

</span>

---

We have established that, in order to minimise the length, the hub $D$
should lie on the red axis of symmetry associated with vertex $A$.
But of course, we can repeat this argument for $B$ and $C$ as well!
There are three axes of symmetry, and they happen to intersect in a
point at the centre of the triangle.
Since $D$ should lie on each of these lines, it must lie at the centre
of the triangle, as depicted in Figure 7.
This solves the minimal network problem on an equilateral triangle!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner7.png" width="40%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 7. The minimal network on an
    equilateral triangle.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Before we go on, we note a couple of features of this trident graph.
We have a point in the centre, with three incoming edges separated by
angle $120^\circ$.
Remarkably, this is a completely general feature of minimal networks!
Any time we add a hub, it will have three spokes separated by equal
angles.
To see why, read on!

### 2.2. Deforming the triangle <a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a> 

We are now going to take our solution to the equilateral triangle and
slowly deform it.
In other words, we imagine slowly moving the corners of the triangle
so it is no longer equilateral.
What will happen to the optimal position of the hub $D$?
Since everything is being smoothly modified, the position of the hub
should change smoothly as well.
The smooth changes are depicted as squiggly purple paths in Figure 8.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner8.png" width="35%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 8. The optimal hub position changes smoothly
    as we deform the corners.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Since the hub position changes smoothly, it should stay inside the
triangle for small deformations of the corners.
But for triangles which are very far from equilateral, you might
imagine that the hub actually *intersects* one of the corners, and our
trident network becomes a simpler triangular network, formed from two
sides of the triangle.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner9.png" width="45%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 9. At some critical angle, the trident
    network becomes a triangular one.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

We picture this in Figure 9 above.
In this diagram, $B$ remains fixed in position, but $A$ and $C$ slowly
lower and open out the angle of the triangle, and the optimal hub $D$
moves down as they do so.
At some critical angle $\theta_\text{crit}$ (coloured olive in Figure 9), it
will coincide with $B$.
The question is: what is the angle?

It turns out this critical angle is $\theta_\text{crit} = 120^\circ$. Although we won't provide a watertight
proof, we can give a plausibility argument.
Let's return to the equilateral triangle.
Instead of adding a hub in the middle, suppose that $D$ is in fact a
fourth city fixed in place.
Clearly, the solution in Figure 7 is still optimal, since if adding
more hubs reduced the total length, we could add more hubs in our
original three city problem to reduce length!
If I now remove any of the corner cities $A$, $B$ or $C$, the optimal
network simply removes the corresponding leg of the trident (Figure 10).

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner10.png" width="40%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 10. Removing a corner city removes a
    leg from the equilateral trident.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

I'll let you explore why we only remove a leg, rather than adding a
whole new hub, in the next problem.

---

*Exercise 5 (cutting corners).* Suppose that in Figure 10, we can add
a new hub $E$ which reduces the length of the network.
Explain how adding $E$ could reduce the length of the network in
Figure 7, and thereby improve our solution for the equilateral
triangle.
Since we have already argued that Figure 7 is minimal, we clearly
cannot find such a hub $E$!

*Note.* This is an example of a
 [proof by contradiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction). We
 assume something we want to show is false, and by demonstrating that
 it leads to a contradiction with known facts, reason backwards to
 conclue that it cannot be true.

---

So, we should be satisfied that for an angle of $\theta = 120^\circ$,
the trident collapses into a triangular network.
But could it happen earlier, with $\theta_\text{crit} < 120^\circ$?
We can actually run Figure 9 in reverse to see this won't happen.
Imagine that $A$ and $C$ move *up* along the purple curves from the
initial angle of $120^\circ$.
Then the hub $D$ should smoothly move up as well.
Thus, we conclude that $\theta_\text{crit} = 120^\circ$.
This is not a fully rigorous proof, but I hope a plausible one.

### 2.3. Hubs and spokes <a id="sec-2-3" name="sec-2-3"></a>

All this work with triangles pays off with a powerful result about
minimal networks for *any* number of cities:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
In any minimal network, all hubs have three incoming legs separated by angles of $120^\circ$.
</span>

By "hub", we mean an additional point on the network (like a train
station) we added to reduce the total length.
The argument is beautiful and simple, though like Exercise 5, it
involves a proof by contradiction.

---

*Proof.*
Our first step is to show that it is impossible for a hub to have
incoming edges separated by less than $120^\circ$.
Suppose we have cities $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ connected by a
minimal rail network.
Also suppose there is a hub station $H$ with incoming rail lines
separated by less than
$\theta_\text{crit} = 120^\circ$, as on the left in Figure 11.
There may be other incoming lines (the horizontal lines in Figure 11),
but these will play no role in our proof and can be ignored.

We can build two new stations on these outgoing legs, $h_1$ and $h_2$,
which are (for simplicity) the same distance from $H$.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner11.png" width="80%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 11. Left: A hub with incoming
    angle less than 120¬∞. Right: A shorter network.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

It's easy to see that every angle in this triangle is less than
$120^\circ$, since the angles at $h_1$ and $h_2$ are at most
$90^\circ$, and we've assume the angle at $H$ is less than
$120^\circ$.
Thus, from our work in the previous section, we know that the minimal
network connecting $h_1$, $h_2$ and $H$ is not the triangle we have
drawn, but a trident with another hub $h_3$ in the middle!
This strictly decreases the length of the network (shown right in
Figure 11), and hence, our original network must not have been
minimal.
There's our contradiction!

So, we know that any hub must have spokes separated by at least
$120^\circ$.
How do we know that there are three, separated by exactly $120^\circ$?
This is very simple.
Suppose two lines enter $H$, separated by more than $120^\circ$.
Then there can only be two incoming edges, joining $H$ to some cities
$A$, and $B$, since any additional lines would have to be closer than
$120^\circ$ to one of these lines, which contradicts the result we
just proved.
So, we have the situation depicted on the left of Figure 12:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/steiner12.png" width="80%"/>
		    <figcaption><i>Figure 12. Left: A hub with incoming
    angle greater than 120¬∞. Right: A shorter network.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Hopefully you can see what goes wrong. If there is a "kink" in the
line, with angle $\theta \neq 180^\circ$, then we can obtain a shorter
network be deleting $H$ and directly connecting $A$ and $B$!
