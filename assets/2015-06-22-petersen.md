**June 22, 2015.** *A quick post on a beautiful family of graphs, and the new masters course at Oxford.*

<h3>
The Petersen family</h3>
The&nbsp;<i>Petersen family</i>&nbsp;is an elegant set of graphs related by the <i>Δ-Y transformation</i>. This replaces a 3-cycle (Δ) with a 3-point star (Y), or vice versa:<br />

<span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span>
<span style="text-align: center;">We start with the&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: center;">Petersen graph (</span><span style="text-align: center;">hence the nomenclature), and fill out the orbit under Δ-Y transformations. This orbit turns out to be finite, as can be laboriously verified. The orbit is pictured below, with the Petersen graph at the bottom and transformations represented by blue edges.</span><br />

Robertson, Seymour and Thomas (1993)&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9301216v1.pdf">proved</a>&nbsp;that the Petersen family is the set of&nbsp;<i>forbidden minors</i>&nbsp;for linklessly embeddable graphs in 3-space. In other words, a graph can be embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space without links (interlinked loops) if and only if we&nbsp;<i>cannot&nbsp;</i>delete edges and contract vertices so that we end up with a member of the Petersen family.<br />
<br />
This characterisation of a class of graphs in terms of forbidden minors is a special case of a very deep theorem proved in 2004 by Robertson and Seymour, the&nbsp;<i>graph minor theorem</i>. Any set of graphs closed under the taking of minors has a <i>finite</i> set of forbidden minors! Enumerating forbidden minors is typically very hard. For more details, Diestel's text&nbsp;<i><a href="http://diestel-graph-theory.com/">Graph Theory</a></i>&nbsp;is a good place to start. But mainly, I just wanted an excuse to show David Eppstein's awesome picture!<br />
<h3>
New course at Oxford</h3>
The University of Oxford is set to offer a new masters course in mathematical and theoretical physics, the&nbsp;<a href="https://mmathphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/">MMathPhys</a>. Based on the&nbsp;<a href="https://mmathphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/handbook.pdf">course guide</a>, it resembles the Part III at Cambridge but with less maths and perhaps a slightly wider range of physics. The handbook is written in endearingly stuffy Oxbridge prose, and includes silly latinate titles for different&nbsp;<a href="https://mmathphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/pathways.pdf">specialisations</a>, e.g.,<br />

SUPERCORDULA = hard-core string theorist<br />
DURACELLA = hard-core hard condensed matter theorist<br />
GAIA = geophysicist/climate physicist<br />
COMPLICATA = complexity scientist.<br />

Jokes aside, this seems like an exciting variation on the Part III theme.
