**April 30, 2020.** *Light wobbles up and down in a particular
  direction. From this simple fact, we develop enough quantum quantum
  mechanics to share secrets and build a quantum computer.*

Classically, light consists of intertwined electric and magnetic
fields, separately wobbling up and down, but at right angles to each
other.
In quantum mechanics, this wave can also be viewed as a particle, the
*photon*.
Thus, a single photon has some plane in which the corresponding
electric field wobbles up and down.
This is called the *polarization* of the photon.

Let's set up a coordinate system with the $z$-axis coinciding with the
path of the photon, and $x$ and $y$ perpendicular to it.
The polarization makes an angle $\theta$ with respect to the $x$-axis,
as picture below.
We can place the angle on the unit circle in the $x$-$y$ plane, and
recall that the coordinates of the corresponding point are

$$
x = \cos\theta, \quad y = \sin \theta.
$$

A *polariser* is a slit in the same $x$-$y$ plane, at a possibly
different angle.
Surprisingly, experiments with polarisers (that you can do at home)
reveal the basic features of quantum mechanics!
