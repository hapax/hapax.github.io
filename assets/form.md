**January 26, 2021.** *Various musings on the philosophies of science, mathematics, and Aristotle.*

#### Introduction

Explanations come to an end somewhere.

Reductionism is the idea that you explain stuff with
smaller stuff, and keep going until you stop.
In many ways, this describes the explanatory program of 20th century
physics, which, starting from the puzzles of 19th century statistical mechanics,
conjured up atoms, subatomic particles, the zoo of the Standard Model, and even
tinier hypothetical entities like strings and spin foams.
Most physicists spend their time in a lab, on a computer, or by a
blackboard, trying to reduce complex things to simple things they understand.
So like Platonism in mathematics, reductionism in physics simply makes
a philosophy out of everyday practice.
*We* break stuff down, so things reduce; *we* play with
mathematical objects, so they exist.

But like Platonism, reductionism is a convenient fiction, or rather, a
caricature in which some things are emphasised at the cost of others.
And given the reverence which which philosophers hold the considered
ontological verdicts of science, it's worth asking: what does science really tell us about the
universe? What sorts of objects are necessary for explanation? Does
explanation go only downwards, or upwards, or can it go sideways? Is
there evidence for eliminativism? What has explanation to do with
existence anyway?
This post hopefully adds a dash of novelty, here and there, to
old (and in some cases hopelessly outdated) debates.

#### What is a particle?

It is raining instructions out there; it’s raining programs; it’s
raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading, algorithms. That is not a
metaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if it were
raining floppy discs.

Physical objects can be described at different levels.
A shoe is constructed from flat sheets of material, curved, cut,
marked, and stuck together in clever ways; materials
curve and stick by virtue of their constituent
chemicals, usually long, jointed molecular chains called polymers;
molecules, in turn, are built like tinkertoys from Nature's
smorgasboard of atoms; and each atom is a tiny solar system, with
electrons whirring around a dense core of protons and neutrons.
Thus, some philosophers conclude, only electrons, protons, and
neutrons exist.
