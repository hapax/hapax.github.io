**February 8, 2021.** *Some philosophical reflections on the nature of
  scientific explanation, structure, emergence, and the unreasonable
  effectiveness of mathematics.*

#### Introduction

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Explanations must come to an end somewhere.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Ludwig Wittgenstein</i> </div>

Reductionism is the idea that you explain stuff with
smaller stuff, and keep going until you stop.
In many ways, this describes the explanatory program of 20th century
physics, which, starting from the 19th century puzzles of statistical mechanics,
conjured up atoms, subatomic particles, the zoo of the Standard Model, and even
tinier hypothetical entities like strings and spin foams.
Most physicists spend their time in a lab, on a computer, or in front
of a blackboard, trying to reduce complex things to simple things they understand.
So like Platonism in mathematics, reductionism in physics simply makes
a philosophy out of everyday practice.
We break stuff down, so things reduce; we play abstractly with
mathematical objects, so they exist abstractly.

But like Platonism, reductionism is a convenient fiction, or rather, a
caricature in which some things are emphasised at the cost of others.
And given the reverence which which philosophers hold the considered
ontological verdicts of science, it's worth asking: what does science really tell us about the
universe? What sorts of objects are necessary for explanation? Does
explanation go only upwards, or can it go downwards or sideways?
Should we eliminate the things we explained? And what has explanation
to do with existence anyway?
This post is my attempt to unconfuse myself about some of these questions.
<!-- adds a dash of novelty and modern
physics to old (and in some cases hopelessly outdated) debates. -->

#### The existence of shoes

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
... our common sense conception of psychological phenomena constitutes a
radically false theory, a theory so fundamentally defective that both
the principles and ontology of that theory will eventually be
displaced, rather than smoothly reduced, by completed neuroscience.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Paul Churchland</i> </div>

Physical objects can be described at different levels.
A shoe is constructed from flat sheets of material, curved, cut,
marked, and stuck together in clever ways; materials
curve and stick by virtue of their constituent
chemicals, usually long, jointed molecular chains called polymers;
polymers, in turn, are built like lego from a smorgasboard of elements;
and each elemental atom is a dense nuclear core, surrounded by
electrons whirring around in elaborate orbitals.

From the properties of the neutrons, protons and
electrons, it seems we can work our way upwards, and infer everything
else.
The laws of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism determine the
orbital structure of the atom. The valence shell of the atom
determines how it can combine with other atoms to form
chemicals. Finally, the structural motifs and functional groups of the
polymers gives it the properties the industrial chemist, the designer,
and the cobbler exploit to make a shoe.
Thus, some philosophers conclude, only electrons, protons, and
neutrons exist.
The rest can be eliminated as unnecessary
ontological baggage.
This view is called *eliminative reductionism*.
It is a hardcore philosophy which does not believe in shoes [<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>].

There is a gentler, less silly form of reductionism which grants the
existence of shoes, but insists that they are (in the phrase of Jack
Smart) nothing "over and above" the constituent subatomic particles.
The shoe "just is" electrons and protons and neutrons, in some order;
this is what we mean by a shoe.
There are others way to characterise the reduction, <!--
for instance, that the properties of the shoe "follow"
from, or are "completely explained by", those of the subatomic particles.
In fact, there is--> and a whole literature devoted to the attendant
subtleties, but most fall under the heading of analytic
micro-quibbles.
<!-- , and won't concern us here.-->
Instead, we will make a much simpler observation: order matters.

Clearly, if we took those subatomic particles, and arranged them in a
different way, we would get different elements, different chemicals,
and a duck or a planetesimal instead of a shoe.
Arrangement is important.
It is patently absurd to try and explain the bulk properties of the
shoe---the fact that it fits around a human foot, for
instance---without appeal to arrangement, since a different
order yields objects which do not fit around a foot.
<!-- If one objects that "fitting around a foot" is some sort of
anthropocentric folly due for elimination, replace it with, 
Philip Anderson was perhaps the first physicist to make this argument,
in his famous article ["More is Different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf). -->
Since order has *explanatory* significance, it should presumably be
tarred with the same ontic brush we apply to things like electrons.

Of course, one may object that explanation does not equal existence.
I can handily account for the continual disappearance of my socks by
the hypothesis of sock imps.
But this is a bad explanation! It's not consistent with other reliably known facts about the world.
Sock imps don't make the ontic cut, not because there is no link between
explanation and what we deem to exist, but because that link should
only be made for *robust* explanations, and the poor little sock imps collapse
at the first empirical hurdle.
That different arrangements of things have different properties is
robust, almost to the point of truism, and there seems to be no
principled reason to ban order, or *structure* as we will call it,
from our ontology.

#### Emergence vs structure

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
More is different.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Philip W. Anderson</i> </div>

It's worth noting the parallel
to *emergence*.
In his famous article
["More is Different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf),
Philip W. Anderson argued for the idea of domain-specific laws and
dynamical principles which did not follow the strict, one-way
explanatory hierarchy of reduction, particularly in his field of
condensed matter physics.
And indeed, condensed matter makes a science of order itself,
studying how properties of macroscopic wholes (such as phases of
matter) "emerge" from the arrangement of microscopic parts.
Anderson thought of emergence as patterns that appear when you "zoom
out" from the constituents, but which are still made from the
constituents; we are just describing those constituents at a different level.
<!-- the microscopic perspective as the wrong "level"
of description, like being too zoomed in on a microscope, but I think that
it is simply different information. -->

But this seems to suffer from the same problem as a reductionist
account of shoes.
The "emergent properties" are not properties of the constituents at
all!
The symmetries, order parameters, <!-- which measure their brokenness,
and collective excitations which emerge as long-range messengers of
disorder, a are not simply the microscopics "zoomed out".--> and
collective excitations studied by condensed matter physicists are
properties of the arrangements themselves.
Famously, systems made from totally different materials can
exhibit the same behaviour [<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>]!
They are something new, something "over and above" the spins of the
lattice, or the carbon atoms of a hexagonal monolayer, since different
arrangements of those same parts would have different properties.
We can turn Anderson's snappy slogan around:
*different is more*. If arranging things differently gives them new
and different properties, it is a sign of structure, and structure is
something over and above the component parts themselves.
<!-- often characterising phases of matter in terms of
what are called *order parameters*, numbers which characterise the
brokenness of a symmetry. -->

#### What is a particle?

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
It is raining instructions out there; it’s raining programs; it’s
raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading, algorithms. That is not a
metaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if it were
raining floppy discs.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Richard Dawkins</i> </div>

We don't need emergence to argue for structure; we can use the
elementary components themselves.
When philosophers talk about reductionism, they tend to imagine
subatomic particles as small, indivisible blobs, without internal
organisation or further ontological bells and whistles. An electron
might have properties like mass or charge, and obey the curious dictates of quantum mechanics,
but all this is packaged irreducibly and not worth further discussion.
But if we try and unpack all these "simple" properties, we will find
that, like the magic bag of Mary Poppins, a particle is much deeper
than it first appears!
The Large Hadron Collider does not produce evidence for tiny,
structureless blobs.
Rather, it confirms at a rate of petabytes per second that the universe is made of mathematics.

The state-of-the-art definition of a particle is
<!-- (as
[this Quanta article](quantamagazine.org/what-is-a-particle-20201112)
humorously explores) --> a bit of a mouthful: an *irreducible
representation of the Lorentz group*.
In plain English, being a *representation* means that particles are
objects which have or "transform with" symmetries, in the same way a circle looks the same however
you rotate it.
That it is *irreducible* means that it cannot be split into smaller
parts which have the same symmetry, which is the mathematical avatar
of being "indivisible".
Finally, the symmetry itself, the *Lorentz group*, is the same group
describing the shape of empty space according to special relativity.
So, in summary, a particle transforms with the symmetries of empty space, and
cannot be split into parts with this symmetry
[<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>].
Lurking implicitly in the background is the whole framework of
quantum mechanics, and in particular, that particles are *states in a
Hilbert space*. In plain English, we can add and subtract states of a
particle, and compare them to each other.

Thus, every particle is like a mathematical diamond: indivisible,
multifacted, and structured up to its ears.
When philosophers of science eagerly assent to believe whatever the particle physicists
tell them, <!-- particularly when it can be tested with unparalleled
precision at the LHC, --> they may not realise what
they signed up for!
Spacetime, quantum mechanics, and symmetries, the Lorentz group and
Hilbert spaces; these are all welded indissolubly to form the most
robust and fundamental objects in the universe.
Even with something as "simple" as an electron, order is
inescapable.

#### Unreasonable effectiveness and natural patterns

It may feel like the argument has jumped from physical objects to
mathematical objects in one fell, suspiciously Platonist swoop.
Do we need Hilbert space, or might another mathematical concept
suffice?
And does Hilbert space really exist, or is it merely a useful human
invention?
If the latter, why so useful?
This is intentionally designed to rhyme with our earlier statement
that order is a robustly explanatory feature of the world, and
distinct from the things that are ordered.
And mathematics really is the study of order, or structure, or
*patterns*, if you like, according to their own peculiar and abstract
logic.
Physics (and to a lesser extent the other sciences) study *natural
patterns*, the way these structures or forms of order are realised in
the natural world.
That applies not just to emergent behaviour like phases of matter, but
even the crystalline makeup of an elementary particle.

I have tried to motivate this perspective from the nature of physical
explanation, but perhaps it can teach us about mathematical
explanation and its relation to the physical world.
A common criticism of Platonism is that, if mathematical objects exist
in some non-physical realm, the ability to do mathematics must involve
some sort of extrasensory perception. Clearly, our ability to do
mathematics must be grounded in physical experience, and here is a
simple explanation: patterns are naturally realised everywhere, from
cardinal numbers in counting mammoths to topology in tying a knot to
representation theory in colliding protons. We don't need magical
access to the World of Forms to see these things.

Similarly, the
[unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html)
for describing the world, first described by Wigner, seems no more
unreasonable that the effectiveness of geology for describing
earthquakes.
We get the patterns from the world, clean them up, rebrand a little,
and start connecting them together.
The meta-patterns that emerge are remarkable, but the appearance of
"unreasonable effectiveness" is the result of a largely successful PR
campaign to divorce mathematical structures from their physical
origins. As Einstein quipped, "Since the mathematicians have invaded
the theory of relativity, I do not understand it myself anymore."
The abstraction of pseudo-Riemannian geometry follows from the more
concrete act of bouncing light off mirrors.

More and more, we are seeing this converse of unreasonable
effectiveness, where deep mathematical ideas are inspired by physics.
The living embodiment of this trend is Ed Witten, a string theorist
whose contributions to mathematics have been so profound and
wide-ranging that he earned a Fields Medal (the Nobel prize in
mathematics) for his contributions to low-dimensional topology.
Once again, there is no mystery here. It is just the usual state of
affairs, but without Platonist guff to distract us.
The patterns are out there and always have been.

#### What is a pattern?

All this raises the question: what is a pattern? And how is it
conjoined with stuff?
The first and most famous philosophical treatment of these issues is
the
[hylomorphism of Aristotle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/form-matter/),
who argued that objects are a compound of both form (the structure,
order, or patterns I have discussed here) and matter (energy or "raw
stuff", roughly speaking).
I won't discuss Aristotle's ideas more here; suffice to say that have
deeply informed this post.
The interested reader should check out Jame's Franklin's
[book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137400734) on
Aristotle's ideas applied to mathematics.

Instead, I will pick on two smaller problems---uniqueness and
approximation---taking Newton's laws as a concrete example.
Newton formulated his laws of motion in terms of forces and
acceleration. Does the empirical robustness of these laws suggest that
this is the only way to formulate them?
Not at all!
There are two other distinct but equivalent formulations of classical
mechanics, called Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, which explain
the same things, making the same predictions, and so *describe the same natural patterns*. This
suggests to me that although patterns are discovered, *formalisms are
invented*.
To adopt some mathematical language, a pattern is the equivalence
class of descriptions.
There are ways to talk about quantum mechanics without Hilbert spaces,
and particles without representation theory.
That does not mean that the corresponding patterns do not exist, but
rather, they can be described in other ways.

The second issue is how accurate our descriptions must be.
We know that Newton's laws are not correct, and break down in
regimes far-removed from those of everyday experience, such as the
very small (where quantum mechanics applies) or the very fast (where
special relativity applies).
Does this mean we must no longer believe in forces, or Lagrangians, or
Hamiltonians?
To me, this is like the old Platonist quibble that there is no
such thing as a perfect circle in the real world, so we must be
reasoning about something else.
In both cases, the pattern is only *approximately* realised in
nature. The edge is fuzzy.
But approximation is itself subject to structural laws, appearing both
in mathematics (in subjects like analysis, topology, and statistics)
and physics (perturbation theory and renormalisation).
Approximation is everywhere and can be well-b

#### Acknowledgments and references

I'd like to thank Leon Di Stefano for introducing me to Aristotelian
structuralism and many inspiring conversations over the years.
His ideas (as articulated in
[this 2017 debate with James Fodor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0j25NteoXc))
inspired and informed this post.

In terms of literature, I've been particularly influenced by James
Franklin's book,
[*An Aristotelian realist view of mathematics*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137400734).
The SEP entries on
[reductionism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/)
and
[mathematical structuralism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/structuralism-mathematics/)
were also helpful (despite the analytic micro-quibbles).
