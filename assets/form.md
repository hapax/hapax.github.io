**January 26, 2021.** *Various musings on the philosophies of science, mathematics, and Aristotle.*

#### Introduction

Reductionism is the idea that you explain stuff with
smaller stuff, and keep going until you stop.
In many ways, this describes the explanatory program of 20th century
physics, which, starting from the puzzles of 19th century statistical mechanics,
conjured up atoms, subatomic particles, the zoo of the Standard Model, and even
tinier hypothetical entities like strings and spin foams.
Most physicists spend their time in a lab, on a computer, or by a
blackboard, trying to reduce complex things to simple things they understand.
So like Platonism in mathematics, reductionism in physics simply makes
a philosophy out of everyday practice.
We break stuff down, so things reduce; we play with
mathematical objects, so they exist.

But like Platonism, reductionism is a convenient fiction, or rather, a
caricature in which some things are emphasised at the cost of others.
And given the reverence which which philosophers hold the considered
ontological verdicts of science, it's worth asking: what does science really tell us about the
universe? What sorts of objects are necessary for explanation? Does
explanation go only downwards, or upwards, or can it go sideways? Is
there evidence for eliminativism? What has explanation to do with
existence anyway?
This post hopefully adds a dash of novelty, modern physics, and
Aristotelian structuralism to old (and in some cases hopelessly outdated)
debates.

#### The existence of shoes

Physical objects can be described at different levels.
A shoe is constructed from flat sheets of material, curved, cut,
marked, and stuck together in clever ways; materials
curve and stick by virtue of their constituent
chemicals, usually long, jointed molecular chains called polymers;
polymers, in turn, are built like lego from a smorgasboard of elements;
and each elemental atom is a microcosmos, electrons whirring in their elaborate
orbitals around a dense core of protons and neutrons.

From the properties of the neutrons, protons and
electrons, it seems we can work our way upwards, and infer everything
else.
The laws of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism determine the
orbital structure of the atom; the valence shell of the atom
determines how it can combine with other atoms to form chemicals; the
structure motifs and functional groups of the polymers gives it the
properties that the industrial chemist, the cobbler, and the designer
exploit to make a shoe.
Thus, some philosophers conclude, only electrons, protons, and
neutrons exist.
The rest can be eliminated as unnecessary
ontological baggage.
This is called *eliminative reductionism*.
It is a hardcore philosophy which does not believe in shoes.

There is a gentler, less silly form of reductionism which grants the
existence of shoes, but insists that they are (in the phrase of Jack
Smart) nothing "over and above" the constituent subatomic particles.
The shoe "just is" electrons and protons and neutrons, in some order.
There are others way to characterise the reduction, for instance, that the properties of the shoe "follow"
from, or are "completely explained by", those of the subatomic particles.
In fact, there is a whole literature devoted to these subtleties,
though most fall under the heading of analytic micro-quibbles, and
won't concern us here.
Instead, we will ask a much simpler question: why does order matter?

Clearly, if we took those subatomic particles, and arranged them in a
different way, we would get different elements, different chemicals,
and a duck or a cloud or an planetesimal instead of a shoe.
Arrangement is important.
It is patently absurd to try and explain the bulk properties of the
shoe---the fact that is fits around a human foot, for
instance---without appeal to arrangement, since a different
arrangement yields objects which do not fit around a foot.
<!-- If one objects that "fitting around a foot" is some sort of
anthropocentric folly due for elimination, replace it with, 
Philip Anderson was perhaps the first physicist to make this argument,
in his famous article ["More is Different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf). -->

#### What is a particle?

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
It is raining instructions out there; it’s raining programs; it’s
raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading, algorithms. That is not a
metaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if it were
raining floppy discs.

I'd like to thank Leon Di Stefano for introducing me to Aristotle's
ideas on structure and inspiring conversations over the years.
