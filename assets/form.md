**January 26, 2021.** *Various musings on the philosophies of science, mathematics, and Aristotle.*

#### Introduction

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Explanations come to an end somewhere.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Ludwig Wittgenstein</i> </div>

Reductionism is the idea that you explain stuff with
smaller stuff, and keep going until you stop.
In many ways, this describes the explanatory program of 20th century
physics, which, starting from the puzzles of 19th century statistical mechanics,
conjured up atoms, subatomic particles, the zoo of the Standard Model, and even
tinier hypothetical entities like strings and spin foams.
Most physicists spend their time in a lab, on a computer, or by a
blackboard, trying to reduce complex things to simple things they understand.
So like Platonism in mathematics, reductionism in physics simply makes
a philosophy out of everyday practice.
We break stuff down, so things reduce; we play with
mathematical objects, so they exist.

But like Platonism, reductionism is a convenient fiction, or rather, a
caricature in which some things are emphasised at the cost of others.
And given the reverence which which philosophers hold the considered
ontological verdicts of science, it's worth asking: what does science really tell us about the
universe? What sorts of objects are necessary for explanation? Does
explanation go only upwards, or can it go downwards or sideways? Is
there evidence for eliminativism? What has explanation to do with
existence anyway?
This post hopefully adds a dash of novelty, modern physics, and
Aristotelian structuralism to old (and in some cases hopelessly outdated)
debates.

#### The existence of shoes

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
In some sense, structure---functional structure in the teleological
sense, as opposed to mere crystalline shape---must also be considered
a stage... in the hierarchy of broken symmetries.

Physical objects can be described at different levels.
A shoe is constructed from flat sheets of material, curved, cut,
marked, and stuck together in clever ways; materials
curve and stick by virtue of their constituent
chemicals, usually long, jointed molecular chains called polymers;
polymers, in turn, are built like lego from a smorgasboard of elements;
and each elemental atom is a microcosm, electrons whirring in their elaborate
orbitals around a dense nuclear core.

From the properties of the neutrons, protons and
electrons, it seems we can work our way upwards, and infer everything
else.
The laws of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism determine the
orbital structure of the atom; the valence shell of the atom
determines how it can combine with other atoms to form chemicals; the
structural motifs and functional groups of the polymers gives it itthe
characteristic properties that the industrial chemist, the designer,
and the cobbler exploit to make a shoe.
Thus, some philosophers conclude, only electrons, protons, and
neutrons exist.
The rest can be eliminated as unnecessary
ontological baggage.
This view is called *eliminative reductionism*.
It is a hardcore philosophy which does not believe in shoes.

There is a gentler, less silly form of reductionism which grants the
existence of shoes, but insists that they are (in the phrase of Jack
Smart) nothing "over and above" the constituent subatomic particles.
The shoe "just is" electrons and protons and neutrons, in some order.
There are others way to characterise the reduction, for instance, that the properties of the shoe "follow"
from, or are "completely explained by", those of the subatomic particles.
In fact, there is a whole literature devoted to these subtleties,
though most fall under the heading of analytic micro-quibbles, and
won't concern us here.
Instead, we will make a much simpler observation: order matters.

Clearly, if we took those subatomic particles, and arranged them in a
different way, we would get different elements, different chemicals,
and a duck or a cloud or an planetesimal instead of a shoe.
Arrangement is important.
It is patently absurd to try and explain the bulk properties of the
shoe---the fact that it fits around a human foot, for
instance---without appeal to arrangement, since a different
order yields objects which do not fit around a foot.
<!-- If one objects that "fitting around a foot" is some sort of
anthropocentric folly due for elimination, replace it with, 
Philip Anderson was perhaps the first physicist to make this argument,
in his famous article ["More is Different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf). -->
Since order has *explanatory* significance, it should presumably be
tarred with the ontic brush we apply to useful explanatory devices
like electrons.

Of course, one may object that explanation does not equal existence.
I can handily explain the continual disappearance of my socks by
invoking the hypothesis of sock imps.
But this is a bad explanation! It's not consistent with other reliably known facts about the world.
Sock imps don't make the ontic cut, not because there is no link between
explanation and what we deem to exist, but because that link should
only be made for *robust* explanations.
That different arrangements of the same basic constituents will have
different properties is robust, almost to the point of truism, and
there is no reason to ban order, or *structure* as we will call it,
from our ontology.

In his famous article
["More is Different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf),
Philip W. Anderson made this argument from a slightly different
perspective.
Anderson was arguing for *emergence* in condensed matter physics, the
idea of domain-specific laws and dynamical principles which did not
follow the strict, one-way explanatory hierarchy of reduction.
And indeed, condensed matter physics makes a science of order itself,
studying howe macroscopic properties of materials (such as phases of
matter) emerge from the arrangement of microscopic components.
Anderson thought of the microscopic perspective as the wrong "level"
of description, an incorrect zoom, but I think that it is simply
different information.
The symmetries, order parameters which measure their brokenness,
collective excitations which emergy as long-range descriptions of
breaking, and so on, are something over and above the components.
<!-- often characterising phases of matter in terms of
what are called *order parameters*, numbers which characterise the
brokenness of a symmetry. -->

#### What is a particle?

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
It is raining instructions out there; it’s raining programs; it’s
raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading, algorithms. That is not a
metaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if it were
raining floppy discs.

I'd like to thank Leon Di Stefano for introducing me to Aristotelian
structuralism and many inspiring conversations over the years.
