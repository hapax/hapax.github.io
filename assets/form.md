**January 26, 2021.** *Various musings on the philosophies of science, mathematics, and Aristotle.*

#### Introduction

Explanations come to an end somewhere.

Reductionism is the idea that you explain stuff with
smaller stuff which makes it up, and keep going until you stop.
In many ways, this describes the explanatory program of 20th century
physics, which from the statistical physics of the 19th century,
conjured up atoms, subatomic particles, the zoo of the Standard Model, and even
tinier entities like strings or spin foams.
Most physicists spend their days in the lab or by the blackboard,
trying to break complex phenomena down into simple parts.
So like Platonism in mathematics, reductionism in physics simply makes
a philosophy of everyday practice.
We break stuff down, so things reduce; we play with
mathematical objects, so they exist.

But like Platonism, reductionism is a convenient fiction, or rather, a
caricature in which some things are emphasised at the cost of others.
And given the reverence in which philosophers hold the ontological
verdicts of science, it's worth asking: what does science really tell us about the
universe? What sorts of objects are necessary for explanation? Does
explanation go only downwards, or upwards, or can it go sideways? Is
there evidence for eliminativism? What has explanation to do with
existence anyway?
This post hopefully adds a dash of novelty, here and there, to some
old (and in some cases hopelessly outdated) debates.

#### What is a particle?

It is raining instructions out there; it’s raining programs; it’s
raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading, algorithms. That is not a
metaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if it were
raining floppy discs.

Physical objects can be described at different levels.
A shoe is constructed from flat sheets of material, curved, cut,
marked, and stuck together in various ingenious ways; these materials
curve, stick, and endure due to the properties of their constituent
chemicals, usually long, jointed molecular chains called polymers;
these chemicals, in turn, are built like lego from Nature's palette of
atoms; and each atom is a tiny solar system, with electrons orbiting
the dense core of protons and neutrons.
