**January 26, 2021.** *Various musings on the philosophies of science, mathematics, and Aristotle.*

#### Introduction

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Explanations come to an end somewhere.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Ludwig Wittgenstein</i> </div>

Reductionism is the idea that you explain stuff with
smaller stuff, and keep going until you stop.
In many ways, this describes the explanatory program of 20th century
physics, which, starting from the 19th century puzzles of statistical mechanics,
conjured up atoms, subatomic particles, the zoo of the Standard Model, and even
tinier hypothetical entities like strings and spin foams.
Most physicists spend their time in a lab, on a computer, or by a
blackboard, trying to reduce complex things to simple things they understand.
So like Platonism in mathematics, reductionism in physics simply makes
a philosophy out of everyday practice.
We break stuff down, so things reduce; we play abstractly with
mathematical objects, so they exist abstractly.

But like Platonism, reductionism is a convenient fiction, or rather, a
caricature in which some things are emphasised at the cost of others.
And given the reverence which which philosophers hold the considered
ontological verdicts of science, it's worth asking: what does science really tell us about the
universe? What sorts of objects are necessary for explanation? Does
explanation go only upwards, or can it go downwards or sideways? Is
there evidence for eliminativism? What has explanation to do with
existence anyway?
This post hopefully adds a dash of novelty, modern physics, and
Aristotelian structuralism to old (and in some cases hopelessly outdated)
debates.

#### The existence of shoes

Physical objects can be described at different levels.
A shoe is constructed from flat sheets of material, curved, cut,
marked, and stuck together in clever ways; materials
curve and stick by virtue of their constituent
chemicals, usually long, jointed molecular chains called polymers;
polymers, in turn, are built like lego from a smorgasboard of elements;
and each elemental atom is a microcosm, electrons whirring in their elaborate
orbitals around a dense nuclear core.

From the properties of the neutrons, protons and
electrons, it seems we can work our way upwards, and infer everything
else.
The laws of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism determine the
orbital structure of the atom; the valence shell of the atom
determines how it can combine with other atoms to form chemicals; the
structural motifs and functional groups of the polymers gives it the
characteristic properties that the industrial chemist, the designer,
and the cobbler exploit to make a shoe.
Thus, some philosophers conclude, only electrons, protons, and
neutrons exist.
The rest can be eliminated as unnecessary
ontological baggage.
This view is called *eliminative reductionism*.
It is a hardcore philosophy which does not believe in shoes.

There is a gentler, less silly form of reductionism which grants the
existence of shoes, but insists that they are (in the phrase of Jack
Smart) nothing "over and above" the constituent subatomic particles.
The shoe "just is" electrons and protons and neutrons, in some order.
There are others way to characterise the reduction, for instance, that the properties of the shoe "follow"
from, or are "completely explained by", those of the subatomic particles.
In fact, there is a whole literature devoted to these subtleties,
though most fall under the heading of analytic micro-quibbles, and
won't concern us here.
Instead, we will make a much simpler observation: order matters.

Clearly, if we took those subatomic particles, and arranged them in a
different way, we would get different elements, different chemicals,
and a duck, cloud or planetesimal instead of a shoe.
Arrangement is important.
It is patently absurd to try and explain the bulk properties of the
shoe---the fact that it fits around a human foot, for
instance---without appeal to arrangement, since a different
order yields objects which do not fit around a foot.
<!-- If one objects that "fitting around a foot" is some sort of
anthropocentric folly due for elimination, replace it with, 
Philip Anderson was perhaps the first physicist to make this argument,
in his famous article ["More is Different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf). -->
Since order has *explanatory* significance, it should presumably be
tarred with the same ontic brush we apply to things like electrons.

Of course, one may object that explanation does not equal existence.
I can handily explain the continual disappearance of my socks by
the hypothesis of sock imps.
But this is a bad explanation! It's not consistent with other reliably known facts about the world.
Sock imps don't make the ontic cut, not because there is no link between
explanation and what we deem to exist, but because that link should
only be made for *robust* explanations, and the sock imps collapse
at the first empirical hurdle.
That different arrangements of things have different properties is
robust, almost to the point of truism, and there seems to be no
principled reason to ban order, or *structure* as we will call it,
from our ontology.

#### Emergence

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
More is different.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Philip W. Anderson</i> </div>

It's worth noting the parallel
to *emergence*.
In his famous article
["More is Different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf),
Philip W. Anderson argued for the idea of domain-specific laws and
dynamical principles which did not follow the strict, one-way
explanatory hierarchy of reduction, particularly in his field of
condensed matter physics.
And indeed, condensed matter makes a science of order itself,
studying how properties of macroscopic wholes (such as phases of
matter) "emerge" from the arrangement of microscopic parts.
Anderson thought of emergence as patterns that appear when you "zoom
out" from the constituents, but which are still made from the
constituents; we are just describing those constituents at a different level.
<!-- the microscopic perspective as the wrong "level"
of description, like being too zoomed in on a microscope, but I think that
it is simply different information. -->

But this seems to suffer from the same problem as a reductionist
account of shoes.
The "emergent properties" are not properties of the constituents at
all!
The symmetries, order parameters, <!-- which measure their brokenness,
and collective excitations which emerge as long-range messengers of
disorder, a are not simply the microscopics "zoomed out".--> and
collective excitations, are properties of the arrangements themselves.
They are something new, something "over and above" the spins of the
lattice, or the carbon atoms of a hexagonal monolayer, since different
arrangements of those same parts would have different properties.
We can turn Anderson's snappy slogan around:
*different is more*. If arranging things differently gives them new
and different properties, it is a sign of structure, which is more
than the component parts themselves.
<!-- often characterising phases of matter in terms of
what are called *order parameters*, numbers which characterise the
brokenness of a symmetry. -->

#### What is a particle?

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
It is raining instructions out there; it’s raining programs; it’s
raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading, algorithms. That is not a
metaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if it were
raining floppy discs.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Richard Dawkins</i> </div>

We don't need emergence to argue for structure; we can use the
elementary components themselves.
When philosophers talk about reductionism, they tend to imagine
subatomic particles as small, indivisible blobs, without internal
organisation or further ontological baggage. They have properties like
charge, or mass, and obey the curious dictates of quantum mechanics,
but all this is packaged irreducibly into the electron and not worth
further discussion.
But if we try and unpack all these "simple" properties, we will find
that, like the magic bag of Mary Poppins, a particle is much deeper
than it first appears.
The Large Hadron Collider does not produce evidence for tiny,
structureless blobs at a rate of petabytes per second.
Rather, it confirms that the universe is made of mathematics!

The state-of-the-art definition of a particle is (as
[this Quanta article](quantamagazine.org/what-is-a-particle-20201112)
humorously explores) a bit of a mouthful: an irreducible
representation of the Lorentz group.
In plain English, being a *representation* means that particles are
objects with symmetries, in the same way a circle looks the same when
you rotate it.
That it is *irreducible* means that it cannot be split into smaller
parts which have the same symmetry, which is the mathematical avatar
of being "indivisible".
Finally, the symmetry itself, the *Lorentz group*, is the same group
describing the shape of empty space, according to special relativity.
So a particle obeys the symmetries associated with empty space, and
cannot be split into parts with this symmetry.

Although it is indivisible in the sense of representation theory, this
is a highly organised and multifaceted object. When philosophers of
science eagerly assent to believe whatever the particle physicists
tell them, particularly when it can be tested with unparalleled
precision at the LHC, they may not realise what
they signed up for!
