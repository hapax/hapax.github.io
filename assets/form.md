**January 26, 2021.** *Various musings on the philosophies of science, mathematics, and Aristotle.*

#### Introduction

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Explanations must come to an end somewhere.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Ludwig Wittgenstein</i> </div>

Reductionism is the idea that you explain stuff with
smaller stuff, and keep going until you stop.
In many ways, this describes the explanatory program of 20th century
physics, which, starting from the 19th century puzzles of statistical mechanics,
conjured up atoms, subatomic particles, the zoo of the Standard Model, and even
tinier hypothetical entities like strings and spin foams.
Most physicists spend their time in a lab, on a computer, or in front
of a blackboard, trying to reduce complex things to simple things they understand.
So like Platonism in mathematics, reductionism in physics simply makes
a philosophy out of everyday practice.
We break stuff down, so things reduce; we play abstractly with
mathematical objects, so they exist abstractly.

But like Platonism, reductionism is a convenient fiction, or rather, a
caricature in which some things are emphasised at the cost of others.
And given the reverence which which philosophers hold the considered
ontological verdicts of science, it's worth asking: what does science really tell us about the
universe? What sorts of objects are necessary for explanation? Does
explanation go only upwards, or can it go downwards or sideways?
Should we eliminate the things we explained? And what has explanation
to do with existence anyway?
This post hopefully adds a dash of Aristotelian novelty and modern
physics to old (and in some cases hopelessly outdated) debates.

#### The existence of shoes

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
... our common sense conception of psychological phenomena constitutes a
radically false theory, a theory so fundamentally defective that both
the principles and ontology of that theory will eventually be
displaced, rather than smoothly reduced, by completed neuroscience.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Paul Churchland</i> </div>

Physical objects can be described at different levels.
A shoe is constructed from flat sheets of material, curved, cut,
marked, and stuck together in clever ways; materials
curve and stick by virtue of their constituent
chemicals, usually long, jointed molecular chains called polymers;
polymers, in turn, are built like lego from a smorgasboard of elements;
and each elemental atom is a dense nuclear core, surrounded by
electrons whirring around in elaborate orbitals.

From the properties of the neutrons, protons and
electrons, it seems we can work our way upwards, and infer everything
else.
The laws of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism determine the
orbital structure of the atom. The valence shell of the atom
determines how it can combine with other atoms to form
chemicals. Finally, the structural motifs and functional groups of the
polymers gives it the properties the industrial chemist, the designer,
and the cobbler exploit to make a shoe.
Thus, some philosophers conclude, only electrons, protons, and
neutrons exist.
The rest can be eliminated as unnecessary
ontological baggage.
This view is called *eliminative reductionism*.
It is a hardcore philosophy which does not believe in shoes [<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>].

There is a gentler, less silly form of reductionism which grants the
existence of shoes, but insists that they are (in the phrase of Jack
Smart) nothing "over and above" the constituent subatomic particles.
The shoe "just is" electrons and protons and neutrons, in some order;
this is what we mean by a shoe.
There are others way to characterise the reduction, <!--
for instance, that the properties of the shoe "follow"
from, or are "completely explained by", those of the subatomic particles.
In fact, there is--> and a whole literature devoted to the attendant
subtleties, but most fall under the heading of analytic
micro-quibbles.
<!-- , and won't concern us here.-->
Instead, we will make a much simpler observation: order matters.

Clearly, if we took those subatomic particles, and arranged them in a
different way, we would get different elements, different chemicals,
and a duck or a planetesimal instead of a shoe.
Arrangement is important.
It is patently absurd to try and explain the bulk properties of the
shoe---the fact that it fits around a human foot, for
instance---without appeal to arrangement, since a different
order yields objects which do not fit around a foot.
<!-- If one objects that "fitting around a foot" is some sort of
anthropocentric folly due for elimination, replace it with, 
Philip Anderson was perhaps the first physicist to make this argument,
in his famous article ["More is Different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf). -->
Since order has *explanatory* significance, it should presumably be
tarred with the same ontic brush we apply to things like electrons.

Of course, one may object that explanation does not equal existence.
I can handily account for the continual disappearance of my socks by
the hypothesis of sock imps.
But this is a bad explanation! It's not consistent with other reliably known facts about the world.
Sock imps don't make the ontic cut, not because there is no link between
explanation and what we deem to exist, but because that link should
only be made for *robust* explanations, and the poor little sock imps collapse
at the first empirical hurdle.
That different arrangements of things have different properties is
robust, almost to the point of truism, and there seems to be no
principled reason to ban order, or *structure* as we will call it,
from our ontology.

#### Emergence vs structure

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
More is different.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Philip W. Anderson</i> </div>

It's worth noting the parallel
to *emergence*.
In his famous article
["More is Different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf),
Philip W. Anderson argued for the idea of domain-specific laws and
dynamical principles which did not follow the strict, one-way
explanatory hierarchy of reduction, particularly in his field of
condensed matter physics.
And indeed, condensed matter makes a science of order itself,
studying how properties of macroscopic wholes (such as phases of
matter) "emerge" from the arrangement of microscopic parts.
Anderson thought of emergence as patterns that appear when you "zoom
out" from the constituents, but which are still made from the
constituents; we are just describing those constituents at a different level.
<!-- the microscopic perspective as the wrong "level"
of description, like being too zoomed in on a microscope, but I think that
it is simply different information. -->

But this seems to suffer from the same problem as a reductionist
account of shoes.
The "emergent properties" are not properties of the constituents at
all!
The symmetries, order parameters, <!-- which measure their brokenness,
and collective excitations which emerge as long-range messengers of
disorder, a are not simply the microscopics "zoomed out".--> and
collective excitations studied by condensed matter physicists are
properties of the arrangements themselves.
Famously, systems made from totally different materials can
exhibit the same behaviour [<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>]!
They are something new, something "over and above" the spins of the
lattice, or the carbon atoms of a hexagonal monolayer, since different
arrangements of those same parts would have different properties.
We can turn Anderson's snappy slogan around:
*different is more*. If arranging things differently gives them new
and different properties, it is a sign of structure, and structure is
something over and above the component parts themselves.
<!-- often characterising phases of matter in terms of
what are called *order parameters*, numbers which characterise the
brokenness of a symmetry. -->

#### What is a particle?

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
It is raining instructions out there; it’s raining programs; it’s
raining tree-growing, fluff-spreading, algorithms. That is not a
metaphor, it is the plain truth. It couldn’t be any plainer if it were
raining floppy discs.
</span>

<div style="text-align: right"><i>Richard Dawkins</i> </div>

We don't need emergence to argue for structure; we can use the
elementary components themselves.
When philosophers talk about reductionism, they tend to imagine
subatomic particles as small, indivisible blobs, without internal
organisation or further ontological bells and whistles. An electron
might have properties like mass or charge, and obey the curious dictates of quantum mechanics,
but all this is packaged irreducibly and not worth further discussion.
But if we try and unpack all these "simple" properties, we will find
that, like the magic bag of Mary Poppins, a particle is much deeper
than it first appears!
The Large Hadron Collider does not produce evidence for tiny,
structureless blobs.
Rather, it confirms at a rate of petabytes per second that the universe is made of mathematics.

The state-of-the-art definition of a particle is
<!-- (as
[this Quanta article](quantamagazine.org/what-is-a-particle-20201112)
humorously explores) --> a bit of a mouthful: an *irreducible
representation of the Lorentz group*.
In plain English, being a *representation* means that particles are
objects with symmetries, in the same way a circle looks the same however
you rotate it.
That it is *irreducible* means that it cannot be split into smaller
parts which have the same symmetry, which is the mathematical avatar
of being "indivisible".
Finally, the symmetry itself, the *Lorentz group*, is the same group
describing the shape of empty space according to special relativity.
So, in summary, a particle has the symmetries associated with empty space, and
cannot be split into parts with this symmetry [<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>].
Lurking implicitly in the background is the whole framework of
quantum mechanics.

Although it is indivisible in the sense of representation theory, this
is a highly organised and multifaceted object. When philosophers of
science eagerly assent to believe whatever the particle physicists
tell them, particularly when it can be tested with unparalleled
precision at the LHC, they may not realise what
they signed up for!
They have signed up for spacetime, quantum mechanics, and symmetries;
these three are welded indissolubly to form the most robust and
fundamental objects in the universe.
Even when an object is indivisible, structure is inescapable.

Particles can have other symmetries as well. An important class is
gauge symmetry, consisting of "internal" degrees of freedom, like a
dial on a gauge. These gauge symmetries are crucial to formulating the
whole Standard Model, and explain, for instance, why an electron has charge.
