Reductionism is the idea that you explain stuff with
smaller stuff which makes it up, and keep going until you stop.
In many ways, this describes the explanatory program of 20th century
physics, which from the statistical puzzles of the 19th century, gave
us atoms, subatomic particles, the zoo of the Standard Model, and even
tinier entities like strings or spin foams.
Most physicists spend their days in the lab or by the blackboard,
trying to break complex phenomena down into simple parts.
So like Platonism in mathematics, reductionism in physics simply makes
a philosophy of everyday practice.
We break stuff down, so that's how the universe works; we play with
mathematical objects, so they exist.
