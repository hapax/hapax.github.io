**January 26, 2021.** *Various musings on the philosophies of science, mathematics, and Aristotle.*

#### Introduction

Reductionism is the idea that you explain stuff with
smaller stuff which makes it up, and keep going until you stop.
In many ways, this describes the explanatory program of 20th century
physics, which from the statistical puzzles of the 19th century, gave
us atoms, subatomic particles, the zoo of the Standard Model, and even
tinier entities like strings or spin foams.
Most physicists spend their days in the lab or by the blackboard,
trying to break complex phenomena down into simple parts.
So like Platonism in mathematics, reductionism in physics simply makes
a philosophy of everyday practice.
We break stuff down, so things reduce; we play with
mathematical objects, so they exist.

But like Platonism, reductionism is a convenient fiction, or rather, a
caricature in which some things are emphasised at the cost of others.
And given the reverence philosophers have for the ontological verdicts of
science, it's worth asking: what does science really tell us about the
universe? Does explanation go only downwards, or upwards, or sideways?
What sorts of objects are necessary for explanation? Is there evidence
for eliminativism?
This post hopefully adds a dash of 21st century novelty to what is, in
effect, a set of ideas stuck in the early 20th century.
