## Stuck in the scrubland

Imagine that, in high school, you had hiking classes.
Every day, for a couple of hours, you and your classmates would trudge
joylessly through a flat and featureless scrubland, with no views, no
peaks, and no apparent goal other than the hike itself.
The point, replies the teacher defensively, whenever a student asks, is to
help you get better at walking, an important life skill you will need as an adult.
Heck, if you can't walk, how do you expect to get a job when you
graduate!

But do you think you would enjoy hiking class?
Would you blame students for losing interest and lagging behind, or
for later identifying as people who hated hiking?
The problem is that, for most people, walking is not an intrinsically
interesting activity.
And the students could legitimately object: in the future, I'm just
going to be walking from my house to the my car.
Why do I need to spend hours doing this each week?
Heck, I'm going to avoid jobs that require a lot of walking.

There seem to be two ways to fix the situation. The first is to
dramatically lower our ambitions, and train students to walk from
their house to their car. But what if a whole sector of the economy
depends on good hiking skills? Without the longer classes, schools
will not produce walkers of the calibre needed to fill those
roles. There are good economic reasons, in this case, to provide
students with opportunities to develop advanced hiking skills.

There may also be benefits to a society where more people hike for
fun. For instance, it would reduce carbon emissions, and might make
for a less frantic, more contemplative culture. This involves some
value judgements, but teachers and curricular authorities are in the
position to make this, and make similar judgements when they put
Shakespeare on the syllabus.

The solution then is simple.
They need to hike interesting terrain, from meadows to swamps to
forests, at first along the comfortable and well-trodden routes. But
by degrees, they should conquer summits, explore uncharted wastes, and
camp in the wilderness.
At the end of the day, hiking is not about the act of walking, but a
way to experience the world. The walking is a means to this end. And
the class will remain a dead letter, pure trudgery, until it gets out
of the scrubland and owns its purpose.

## Changing the landscape

Of course, this is a thinly veiled analogy to high school maths class.
Doing maths, by itself, for itself, is not intrinsically interesting
to most people.
Just like walking, it can get boring quickly.
And hours of math drill, every day, every week, for years, seems like
overkill to develop basic numeracy.
When was the last time you used the quadratic formula on your tax
return?
Or trigonometry to assess the merits of a lease-purchase scheme?
My point is not that trigonometry or the quadratic formula are
useless, but that the stated aim of basic numeracy doesn't match what
we teach in the curriculum.
Clearly, there's some other value system at play.

The teacher is going to find it hard to justify.

We would have less carbon dioxide in the air, and perhaps our
culture would be less frantic, less shallow, and more curious.
But if we wanted more people to walk, hiking class

Let's say the teacher is an avid hiker.
Why do they like hiking?
Maybe it's the chance to commune with nature, or to get away from the
bustle of every life.
Perhaps it's the lure of exploration, or the call of that mountain
summit in the distance.
Whatever it is, when a students asks: why are we doing this?
