**August 13, 2019.** *A manifesto on maths education.*

## Introduction

#### A preamble

I want you to imagine a reality, not so different from our own, where
you were forced to take *hiking classes* in high school.
Every day, for a couple of hours, you and your classmates would trudge
through a featureless scrubland, with no views, no
peaks, and no apparent goal other than the hike itself.
If the class complained that the walk was boring or pointless or too long, the
teacher would reply that walking was an important life
skill.
Heck, if you can't walk, how do you expect to get a job!

Would you have enjoyed this hiking class?
Or would you have lost interest, and started lagging behind?
Maybe, in time, you would come to proudly identify as someone who
sucked at hiking!
The problem with the class is obvious.
For most people, walking is not an intrinsically interesting
activity, particularly if the walk is long!
There needs to be some motivation to walk, something to walk towards
or to look at en route.
That's what *hiking* (as opposed to *walking*) should be about.
But if there's no motivation, it becomes a chore, and rather than being trained to
walk, you will be trained to *avoid walking*.

There are a few different ways we could fix this situation.
The first is to make the connection between practice and real life closer,
exchanging hikes for small, unambitious strolls.
But what if a whole sector of the economy
depends on advanced hiking skills?
What if we need wayfarers, explorers and hunters to help meet the
needs of society as a whole?
If we lower our sights, everyone loses.

Perhaps we should restrict classes to the "natural walkers", the
students who trudge tirelessly and without complaint through the scrubland.
They appear to have the most potential.
But what if walking is a skill that can be *developed*, rather than a
natural ability, like double-jointedness, you're either born with or not?
If so, then just taking natural walkers cuts us off from a huge reservoir of
talent: the students who could become good hikers if they were motivated to walk.

There is a simple way to develop good hikers and maximise access to
talent: stop marching students through the scrubland!
We should take them through varied and stimulating terrain, into the
forest, or towards
the strange rock formations in the distance.
At first, lessons would be along well-marked trails, but with time,
they could learn to camp in the wilderness, explore uncharted wastes
and conquer summits.
This would turn natural walkers into good hikers, and bring others
along who may, with practice, become just as good or better.
By taking them on real hikes, students would learn that hiking is not
about the act of walking, but rather *using walking* to experience and
understand the world.

#### A snapshot

Of course, I'm not really talking about hiking; I'm talking about *maths*.
In this slightly tortured analogy, walking is the ability to manipulate
symbols, to follow rules, to find your way around a formal structure.
Some people are naturally drawn to playing with symbols, some people
aren't.
But maths is not symbol manipulation any more than hiking is walking!
These activities are necessary to mathematics, but they don't
constitute it.
Put a different way, the mathematical world, with its vast topography
of features and landforms, must be traversed by manipulating symbols,
but manipulating symbols is not itself the goal.
And like walking, symbol manipulation is a skill that can be developed.

If you look at most high school textbooks, in North America or
Australia, you could be forgiven for thinking that maths is just a collection of brute formal facts, without context,
without use, without beauty: a scrubland.
What should be a voyage of discovery and empowerment, a journey into
the mathematical world, is a joyless plod for most students.
I know because that was my experience in high school.
I was not a natural symbol manipulator, so maths bored me senseless.

Let me illustrate with a snapshot of the scrubland.
Here are some calculus exercises from a popular Australian textbook.
Calculus is, without exaggeration, one of the great landmarks of human thought.
What does the textbook make of it?

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/specialist1.png"
    width="75%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Calculus "shrubbified".</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

We're finding... rates of change of ... some functions, I guess.
Why am I doing this again?
I mean, what is inverse sine on a Saturday?
Could I get a beer with it?
I may as well be looking at a barcode!
That's how indistinguishable and repetitive these questions are.

They fill me, and I hope you, with existential horror.
This is what I mean by the scrubland.
There are no landmarks, nothing for the eye to latch onto, just an
endless plain of withered, ankle-height shrubs.
In a way, it's perversely impressive how these textbooks take a
milestone of Western thought and "shrubbify" it.

#### The appeal of scrubland

Perhaps I'm being unfair.
Students need to walk before they can hike, or in mathematical
terms, to become handy symbol manipulators before they can do real
maths.
I don't debate this, though I think there are better ways to do it
than walking through scrubland. 
But the real problem here is that *the scrubland never ends*.
What appear to be features on the horizon are just shrubs of a
different colour, and I'll give some examples below.

But wait a second!
Conventional pedagogical wisdom tells us that scrubland drill is
necessary to develop basic walking skills, for students to find their
feet and get somewhere interesting.
Maybe we can disagree about the best way to practice walking, but the
bottom line is that if students never get anywhere, this claim is made
in bad faith.
They drill in order to drill.
So where does the claim come form?
The truth is that scrubland is easy for teachers and easy for
textbook writers.
You don't need to be a good hiker to guide students through the
scrubland, and if you want to write a textbook, just "shrubbify" and
fill the book with minor variants of the same problem.

But the responsibility for getting us out of the scrubland doesn't lie
with teachers, or even textbook writers, but the authorities who write the curriculum.
And from their perspective, it's much easier to maintain the
scrubland, to ride around in a pickup truck and paint things different
colours, than to chart a new course into the mathematical world.
That would take a lot of time and a lot of money, so I can see why they're reluctant.

But as in the hiking analogy, good mathematical skills are
important to society as a whole.
I'm not talking about basic numeracy, the ability to
understand your tax returns or compute a tip.
I'm talking about dealing with the ongoing effects of climate change,
big data, artificial intelligence, and personalised medicine.
The stakes couldn't be higher.
So while reluctance is understandable, I think they need to get out of
the pickup trucks and talk to professional hikers, people who know the
landscape, use the trails.
They need to move mathematics out of the scrubland, and into the 21st
century with all its challenges and complexities.

## The role of beauty

There are two different roads winding off into the mathematical
distance.
The first is the way of *pure* mathematics.
This is the realm of abstraction, of generalisation, of
proof, and most importantly, beauty.
Aesthetic considerations are famously important to pure mathematicians.
The philosopher Bertrand Russell said that pure maths had a "beauty cold
and austere, like that of sculpture", and was "capable of a stern
perfection such as only the greatest art can show".
Along similar lines, the English mathematician G. H. Hardy said
"beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world
for ugly mathematics."

Sound like any high school maths class you ever took?
It's almost as if people got the Hardy quote backwards: there seems to
be no permanent place in the classroom for *beautiful* mathematics.
Let me show you what passes for pure mathematics in our advanced
textbook:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/specialist2.png"
    width="75%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Painting shrubs blue.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

These look different, until you notice they are the *same* questions as
before, but with letters instead of numbers.
There is nothing beautiful or deep here, just the same manipulations
in disguise!
It is the wrong sort of generalisation.
The shrubs may be painted blue, but they are still shrubs.

Instead of dressing up shrubs, we should find a mountain to scale.
In pure mathematics, mountains are things like theorems (important
proven results), conjectures (important unproven results), and
important definitions or examples.
"Important", here, can mean a variety of things, but as Hardy and
Russell suggest, *beauty* is one of the principal criteria.
Some mountains can only be scaled by professionals.
But we don't need to scale the mountain to appreciate and get a
flavour of important results; we can find a nearby hill with a gentler slope and
a partial view of the summit.

#### Example: the mean value theorem

Let's do an example to see what this could look like in practice.
Our mountain will be the *mean value theorem*, an important result
about derivatives.
Instead of scaling the mountain and giving a fully rigorous proof, we
will content ourselves with a good prospect from lower elevations.

Suppose we have some function $f(x)$ defined for $a \leq x \leq b$.
This is pictured on the Cartesian plane below.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt1.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Graphing a function $f(x)$ for $a \leq x
    \leq b$.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Now draw a line between the endpoints of the graph.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt2.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Drawing a line (purple) between the endpoints
    of the graph.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

What happens if we shift the purple line (without tilting) up or down?
In this example, there are two shifts where the line *just touches* (is tangent to)
the curve.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt3v2.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>There are two points at which the line just
    touches the curve.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Is it possible to draw a different graph so the purple line is tangent
at *one* point?
If you give students some time to experiment, they should find
examples like the following:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt4.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>An example where the purple line is tangent
    at a single point.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

What about *no points* where the graphs are tangent?
With some time to play around, students should come to doubt that such
curves exist.
How can they prove it?
One approach lies in the definition of "just touching".
Imagine zooming in infinitely close to the point of tangency, so the blue curve becomes
straight (more or less what we mean by the derivative).
You can convince students that the blue and purple lines
must have the *same slope* at this point of intersection.
If they had different slopes, they would cross each other rather than
being tangent!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt5.png"
    width="35%" />
		    <figcaption><i>At infinite magnification, the purple and
    blue lines must coincide.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
</figure>

This suggests a visual proof, which students could discover for
themselves with judicious guidance.
First of all, it's clear that some of the blue curve should lie above
the purple line, or below the purple line, otherwise it *is* the
purple line and we have (infinitely) many points of tangency.
But let's assume that some of the blue curve lies below the original
purple line.
Now, move the purple line down until it can't go further without
missing the blue curve altogether.
If the purple line wasn't tangent to the blue at this extreme point,
the blue would cross *through* the purple and we could continue moving
it down.
From our earlier discussion, this means they have to be tangent!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt6.png"
    width="65%" />
		    <figcaption><i>A visual "proof"/algorithm to find where
    the purple line is tangent to the blue curve.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Since the purple line is straight, we can easily calculate
its slope:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
$$

We have just heuristically proved the mean value theorem.
For a function $f(x)$ on $a\leq x \leq b$, there is a point $c$ where
the derivative equals the "mean" slope between its endpoints:

$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
$$

Another nice feature of our proof is that (combined with root-finding
methods) it can be turned into an algorithm for finding the point $c$.

## Extra

Sure, you can't hike without walking, and you need plenty of practice
if you want to become a good hiker.
The best way to bring students along is to provide motivation, to
provide interest, and to empower them.

Hopefully, by now you've realised this is a thinly veiled analogy for
maths class.
For so many students, it feels like a pointless trudge through a
landscape without interest, without life, which is stuck in the
scrubland, with a guide who can't explain where they're going or why
they're doing it.
I know because that was my experience in high school.

Of course, this is a thinly veiled analogy to high school maths class.
Doing maths, by itself, for itself, is not intrinsically interesting
to most people.
Just like walking, it can get boring quickly.
And hours of math drill, every day, every week, for years, seems like
overkill to develop basic numeracy.
When was the last time you used the quadratic formula on your tax
return?
Or trigonometry to assess the merits of a lease-purchase scheme?
My point is not that trigonometry or the quadratic formula are
useless, but that the stated aim of basic numeracy doesn't match what
we teach in the curriculum.
Clearly, there's some other value system at play.

The teacher is going to find it hard to justify.

We would have less carbon dioxide in the air, and perhaps our
culture would be less frantic, less shallow, and more curious.
But if we wanted more people to walk, hiking class

Let's say the teacher is an avid hiker.
Why do they like hiking?
Maybe it's the chance to commune with nature, or to get away from the
bustle of every life.
Perhaps it's the lure of exploration, or the call of that mountain
summit in the distance.
Whatever it is, when a students asks: why are we doing this?

And the students could legitimately object that in the future, I'm just
going to be walking from my house to the my car.
Why do I need to spend hours doing this each week?
Heck, I'm going to avoid jobs that require a lot of walking.

They plan to walk from the house to the car, and from the car to work,
and maybe take the dog around the block every now and again.
A job that requires hours of walking? No thank you!

Without the longer classes, schools
will not produce walkers of the calibre needed to fill those
roles. There are good economic reasons, in this case, to provide
students with opportunities to develop advanced hiking skills.

There may also be benefits to a society where more people hike for
fun. For instance, it would reduce carbon emissions, and might make
for a less frantic, more contemplative culture. This involves some
value judgements, but teachers and curricular authorities are in the
position to make this, and make similar judgements when they put
Shakespeare on the syllabus.

We need to change hiking classes so that walks go through interesting
terrain, from meadows to swamps and valleys to forests; at first, along the comfortable and well-trodden routes. But
by degrees, they should conquer summits, explore uncharted wastes, and
camp in the wilderness.
At the end of the day, hiking is not about the act of walking, but a
way to experience the world. The walking is a means to this end. And
the class will remain a dead letter, pure trudgery, until it gets out
of the scrubland and owns its purpose.

Would you blame most students for losing interest and lagging behind,
and later identifying as people who hated hiking?
Of course not!

Unless they are taught to love hiking, they'll have no thought of
walking for hours every day.
Not to mention if it becomes a joyless chore, in which case they'll do
everything they can to avoid it!

Perhaps, also, there are general cultural benefits when everyone
enjoys hiking, for instance, a higher level of average physical fitness, or a
closer connection to nature.

That makes it easier to motivate the whole enterprise, and less likely
to lead to resentment.

Not everywhere can be reached by car.

These natural walkers trudge without complaint, they have stamina,
they have grit.
But sometimes they trudge without purpose, almost too willing to
follow the path, or the teacher, gazing contentedly at their own feet.
These people may make the best hikers, who knows?
But it is more credible that people

At the end of the day, hiking is not about the act of walking itself,
which can be pure drudgery, but rather, to use walking as a way of experiencing
the world.

Perambulatory parable

And these hiking classes will remain a dead letter until they get out
of the scrubland and own their purpose.


Do we really expect them to become devotees of the deductive method

Of course, there will be people who naturally love Euclid.

skill, and you needed it to get by as an adult.

The first is to lower our ambitions and go on short walks.
The connection between practice and real life is then clear, and less
likely to lead to resentment; the teacher can justify the whole
enterprise.

If we lower our sights, society as a whole could lose out.

Perhaps, then, we should restrict hiking classes to those who naturally enjoy
walking and don't mind the drudgery.

These people, one could reason, will obviously become the best hikers.
We can get them running laps through the scrubland and they'll love it!
But is it true that they'll become the best hikers?

be great hikers, if only they developed the walking skills.

Really, we should *make things interesting*, and let the students
decide for themselves whether they want to hike.
This is the solution the astute reader will have guessed immediately.

What if, by restricting our attention to natural walkers, we
miss out on a huge pool of talent, namely those with the potential to
be great hikers if they practice walking?

For most people, this is not an intrisically interesting activity.
In fact, it's particularly boring for mathematicians!
This is because maths is not walking; it's hiking.
It's a way of encountering and understanding and exploring the world
using formal systems.
But maths curricula, at least in Australia and North
America, insist on marching students through the scrubland.

Both of these solutions are unsatisfying because the answer is obvious.

past swamps and
meadows, into forests, along streams and canyons.

This would not only turn natural walkers into good hikers, but
identify others with hiking talent who need more motivation.

The greatest success, in this new paradigm, would be the moment a
student realised that hiking was not about walking, but rather, using
walking to experience and understand the world.

I'm going to pick on an Australian textbook for the most advanced high
school subject.
But, in its defense, all of the textbooks are like this.

But this all depends on whether walking is a skill that can be developed.
If so, then by focusing on natural walkers, we lose access to a huge
pool of talent, namely those with the potential to be great hikers
if only they had the motivation to walk.

The scrubland is an empty philosophy.
We are best served, as individuals and as a society, by showing
students that hiking is not about walking, but rather, using
walking to experience and understand the world.

Walking takes you to interesting places, if you do some planning and
follow your nose.

We should take them through varied and stimulating terrain, into
forests, along streams, down canyons, and up slopes.


Perhaps, then, we should focus on training *natural walkers*
those who walk tirelessly and without complaint through the scrubland.

But maths curricula, at least in Australia and North
America, insist on marching students through the scrubland, turning

These are repetitive, mindless, plug-and-chug problems, and students are
forced to do hundreds of them.

Why do I care about the derivative of $\sin^{-1}(5x/4)$?

What is this for?
Why am I doing any of this?
Why am I even here?
This is what I mean by the scrubland.

endless plain of withered, ankle-height shrubs.

Maybe there are some landmarks in the distance after all, once we get past
the dead shrubs.
What could they look like?

hike into the foothills, armed
only with a compass and a sense of adventure.

There are two directions we could go, which reflect the structure of
mathematics itself.

Perhaps we should show our students some beautiful mathematics.
In my analogy, this could a mountain peak with a particularly glorious view of sunrise.
You need to be a good walker to get there, and the trail may wind
through some shrubby foothills.
More generally, pure mathematicians are like Indiana Jones, venturing
into trackless realms and finding objects of great beauty, before,
almost as an afterthought, bringing them back to civilisation.
This is an activity we should be modelling and advertising and making accessible.


But this is not what happens.
Here's an example of what passes for pure mathematics in our "advanced" textbook:

This is more scrubland, but the shrubs are coloured differently.
There is nothing beautiful about these results, nothing surprising.
They are presented as brute formal facts, with no aesthetic value.

These sort of look like the other problems; in fact, I have a sneaking
suspicion that they are *exactly* the same, but they've replaced numbers with
letters.
These are just shrubs of a different color.

Once again, there is some conventional wisdom at work here.
Students find proofs hard.
If you've ever tried to teach Euclid at a high school level, as many
countries do, you might have noticed this.
You feel like a dentist.
But I don't think it's because proofs are inherently difficult.
Rather, I think it's because throwing Euclid at them, without any
preparation, is a terrible idea.
Most people are not excited by sundry factoids about triangles.
It's a steep learning curve if you don't care about what's at the top
of the hill.

So we need to teach proofs better.
We need to use examples which pique student interest, and teach them
how to reason mathematically step by step.
Start with examples, visual proofs, intuition pumps, heuristics, and
judiciously cut corners.
If you start with Euclid's axioms, that's probably where the student's
relationship with the deductive method is going to end.

We don't usually need to scale the mountain to appreciate some of what
makes these things beautiful.
If the mountain is too steep, find a nearby hill with a gentler slope
and a partial view of the summit.

you could either tell the students, or
let them discover (with some prompting) for themselves.

This is a beautiful result, which is within the means of ordinary
students to discover for themselves with some judicious guidance.
It illustrates some basic principles of mathematical reasoning ---
play, building intuition from examples, induction from the specific to
the general, posing and answering questions.
The proof appears as a sort of *mechanism* which takes any input and
guarantees a tangency point as output.
(The idea that a proof treats an *infinite* number of examples is, I
think, a good way to introduce it in these contexts.)

Conventional wisdom states that students
need to master basic skills by drill before they can move on to more
interesting tasks.
This sounds reasonable, and I'll come back to drill below, but one can
ask: what are the landmarks they're meant to hike towards, now that
they differentiate inverse sine with their eyes closed?

That's the end of my little preamble, and by now you've probably realised
that I'm not really talking about hiking. I'm
talking about *maths*.
In this thinly-veiled analogy, walking is the ability to manipulate
symbols, to follow rules, to find your way around a formal structure.

Mathematics has its own world, a vast topography of features and
landforms, that can only be traversed and navigated by manipulating
symbols; but manipulating symbols is not itself the goal.

To help convey this boredom, let me give you a
snapshot of the scrubland.

There are two different paths heading off into the
mathematical landscape.

it's easy to generate minor variants of the same
question, the same two or three ideas, and make that a chapter of your
textbook.

It's true that students need to practice symbol manipulation somehow,
and I'll say more below about how to do that in a way that doesn't
inspire existential horror.

The traditional claim that students
need to drill in order to *get somewhere interesting* is usually made in bad
faith.

You can take anything and shrubbify it, because all you do is generate
minor variants of the same problem.
Find 15 distinct problems, and you have yourself a textbook.

and a lot of
collaboration with the professional navigators, people who know the
landscape and use the trails.

It looks like we need to prepare some students to do advanced hiking.
But if most students hate walking through scrubland, maybe we should
restrict advanced classes to those who enjoy it, the "natural walkers"
who trudge tirelessly and without complaint for hours.

Mathematics has its own world, a vast topography of features and
landforms that must be traversed by manipulating
symbols, but manipulating symbols is not itself the goal.
