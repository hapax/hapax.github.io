**August 13, 2019.** *A short manifesto on maths education.*

## A perambulatory parable

I want you to imagine a reality, not so different from our own, where
you were forced to take *hiking classes* in high school.
Every day, for a couple of hours, you and your classmates would trudge
through a featureless scrubland, with no views, no
peaks, and no apparent goal other than the hike itself.
When the class complained that the walk was boring and pointless, the
teacher would defensively reply that walking is an important life
skill needed to get as an adult.
Heck, if you can't walk, how do you expect to get a job when you graduate!

Do you think you would have enjoyed this hiking class?
Would you blame most students for losing interest and lagging behind,
and later identifying as people who hated hiking?
Of course not!
The problem is that, for most people, walking is not an intrinsically
interesting activity.
Unless they are taught to love hiking, they'll have no thought of
walking for hours every day.
Not to mention if it becomes a joyless chore, in which case they'll do
everything they can to avoid it!

There seem to be two ways to fix the situation. The first is to
lower our ambitions, and train students for small walks, jaunts around
the block or to the shops.
But what if a whole sector of the economy
depends on advanced hiking skills?
What if there is a need for wayfarers, explorers and hunters?
Not everywhere can be reached by car.
If we lower our ambitions, society as a whole loses out.
Perhaps, also, there are general cultural benefits when everyone
enjoys hiking, for instance, a higher level of average physical fitness, or a
closer connection to nature.

The solution is simple.
We need to hike through interesting terrain, between meadows and swamps,
and from valleys to mountains.
At first, hikes would be along the comfortable and well-trodden routes
while students found their feet and developed confidence, but
later, by degrees, they would learn to camp in the wilderness,
to explore uncharted wastes and conquer summits.
At the end of the day, hiking is not about the act of walking itself,
which can be pure drudgery, but rather, to use walking as a way of experiencing
the world.
Hiking class will remain a dead letter until it gets out
of the scrubland and owns its purpose.

## The intuition pump

Hopefully, by now you've realised this is a thinly veiled analogy for
maths class.
For so many students, it feels like a pointless trudge through a
landscape without interest, without life, which is stuck in the
scrubland, with a guide who can't explain where they're going or why
they're doing it.
I know because that was my experience in high school.

## Extra

Of course, this is a thinly veiled analogy to high school maths class.
Doing maths, by itself, for itself, is not intrinsically interesting
to most people.
Just like walking, it can get boring quickly.
And hours of math drill, every day, every week, for years, seems like
overkill to develop basic numeracy.
When was the last time you used the quadratic formula on your tax
return?
Or trigonometry to assess the merits of a lease-purchase scheme?
My point is not that trigonometry or the quadratic formula are
useless, but that the stated aim of basic numeracy doesn't match what
we teach in the curriculum.
Clearly, there's some other value system at play.

The teacher is going to find it hard to justify.

We would have less carbon dioxide in the air, and perhaps our
culture would be less frantic, less shallow, and more curious.
But if we wanted more people to walk, hiking class

Let's say the teacher is an avid hiker.
Why do they like hiking?
Maybe it's the chance to commune with nature, or to get away from the
bustle of every life.
Perhaps it's the lure of exploration, or the call of that mountain
summit in the distance.
Whatever it is, when a students asks: why are we doing this?

And the students could legitimately object that in the future, I'm just
going to be walking from my house to the my car.
Why do I need to spend hours doing this each week?
Heck, I'm going to avoid jobs that require a lot of walking.

They plan to walk from the house to the car, and from the car to work,
and maybe take the dog around the block every now and again.
A job that requires hours of walking? No thank you!

Without the longer classes, schools
will not produce walkers of the calibre needed to fill those
roles. There are good economic reasons, in this case, to provide
students with opportunities to develop advanced hiking skills.

There may also be benefits to a society where more people hike for
fun. For instance, it would reduce carbon emissions, and might make
for a less frantic, more contemplative culture. This involves some
value judgements, but teachers and curricular authorities are in the
position to make this, and make similar judgements when they put
Shakespeare on the syllabus.

We need to change hiking classes so that walks go through interesting
terrain, from meadows to swamps and valleys to forests; at first, along the comfortable and well-trodden routes. But
by degrees, they should conquer summits, explore uncharted wastes, and
camp in the wilderness.
At the end of the day, hiking is not about the act of walking, but a
way to experience the world. The walking is a means to this end. And
the class will remain a dead letter, pure trudgery, until it gets out
of the scrubland and owns its purpose.
