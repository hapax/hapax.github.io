**August 13, 2019.** *In the 21st century, higher-order mathematical
  skills are more important than ever before. How do we stop
  alienating students and plug some of the holes in the pipeline? It's
  simple: make maths interesting! This calls for collaboration between practicing
  scientists and educators. Together, they can plot a route out of the
  scrubland, and into realms where the beauty and power of
  mathematical thought are evident.*

## Stuck in the scrubland <a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

In high school, I thought maths was boring.
I was skeptical about claims it would help me in real
life --- you don't need trigonometry for your tax returns, or to solve
simultaneous equations at the grocery store --- and found the endless
drill mind-numbing.
There were an infinite number of equations to solve.
Why should I care about any particular one?
I scraped by with passes, copying examples and cramming for tests, but
I thought of maths class as a formal game whose rules I couldn't be
bothered internalising beyond the next test.
I even remember teaching myself how to add fractions and multiply
negative numbers --- at age 15!

In philosophy class a few years later, I was introduced to set theory.
Different sorts of infinity, Russell's paradox, Cantor's
diagonalisation argument --- all of this not only tickled my
philosophical fancy, but a long dormant *aesthetic appreciation* for
mathematics.
It could be beautiful, and just as deep as philosophy.
I also had a recreational interest in physics, and to paraphrase Galileo,
began to see that maths was a formal game played by nature as well.
Eventually, I switched from philosophy to maths and physics and never
looked back.

I was lucky, stumbling later in life into a hidden realm of
extraordinary beauty and power.
But how many students are unlucky?
How many go through high school, numbed by repetition, cramming and
copying just enough to pass tests, never seeing that *there is a
mathematical world out there*!
The problem, I will argue, is that maths education is stuck in a sort of
*scrubland* with no views into that world.
We can make the problem more vivid with an (admittedly tendentious) analogy.

#### A preamble <a id="sec-1-1" name="sec-1-1"></a>

 Instead of maths, imagine you were forced to take *hiking classes* in high school.
Every day, you and your classmates would trudge through a barren,
featureless scrubland, with no views, no peaks, and no apparent goal
other than the hike itself.
Whenever the class complained that the walk was boring or pointless
(and who hikes in real life anyway?) the teacher would recite the
dictum that *walking was an important life skill*.
Heck, if you can't walk, how do you expect to get a job!
Privately, thought, teach had to admit: two monotonous hours in the
scrubland, every day for six years, did seem excessive.
But that's just the way things things were done.

Would you have enjoyed this hiking class?
Or would you have lost interest and started lagging behind?
Maybe, in time, you would have come to proudly identify as a bad hiker.
The problem with these classes is clear.
For most of us, walking is not an intrinsically interesting
activity; there needs to be a motivation to walk, something to walk
towards or to look at en route.
That's what *hiking* proper is all about.
But if there's no motivation, it becomes a chore, and rather than being trained to
hike, you will be trained to *avoid hiking*.

Why have hiking classes anyway?
Why don't we ditch the hikes, and teach students how to walk to the
corner store, the bus stop, or around the block with a dog in tow, the
sort of walking most adults actually do?
This would have made sense a hundred years ago.
But now a whole sector of the economy depends on advanced hiking
skills: we need wayfarers, explorers and hunters to help meet the
needs of society as a whole.
We need hiking classes to act as an intake mechanism, drawing students
into the field and equipping them to explore.

Some students seem to have a natural yen for walking.
They can walk faster, and for longer distances; some hike outside of
class, run the school club, and participate in competitions.
Maybe we should channel our resources towards these "natural walkers"
and let the rest opt out.
But walking is a skill that can be developed, and most of these
"natural walkers" are in fact *motivated by non-scrubland experiences*.
Their parents took them out into nature, or they read about inspiring
walks in a book with pictures.
They don't visit the scrubland in their free time!
These non-scrubland experiences, rather than natural ability, pushed
them to develop their walking skills.

The fix is clear: we should stop marching students through the scrubland.
Instead, we should guide them into varied and stimulating terrain,
through forests, along canyons, and towards the strange rock
formations in the distance.
With time, they could learn to camp in the wilderness, explore
uncharted wastes and conquer summits.
I think interest would blossom in unexpected places.
By going on real hikes, we would stop wasting student time, improve
social outcomes by attracting more students into the field, and
perhaps most importantly, show them that all of nature is out there,
waiting to be relished and explored.
Some students would probably still hate hiking.
But so many more would be enriched.

#### A patch of scrubland <a id="sec-1-2" name="sec-1-2"></a>

I hope the analogy to maths education and its shortcomings is clear.
Walking is the ability to manipulate
symbols.
Some people are naturally drawn to playing with symbols, some people
aren't.
But maths is not symbol manipulation any more than hiking is walking!
These activities might be necessary to mathematics, but they don't
constitute it.
And like walking, symbol manipulation is a skill that can be developed.

If you look at most high school textbooks, you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise.
What should be a journey into
the mathematical world is, in most cases, a joyless plod without context, without use, without
beauty: a scrubland.

		    <figcaption><i>Calculus "shrubbified".</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Here's a patch of scrubland, courtesy of an anonymous Australian textbook.
The topic is calculus, one the great milestones of Western thought.
And here, we're finding... rates of change of ... some functions, I
guess.
What do these functions do?
Why do I care?
I may as well be looking at a barcode.
These questions are unforgivably dull when there is literally hundreds
of years of material to draw on.
This is what I mean by the scrubland: no landmarks, nothing for the eye to latch onto, just an
endless plain of withered, ankle-height shrubs.

#### Roads to nowhere <a id="sec-1-3" name="sec-1-3"></a>

Of course, students need to practice walking before they wander off
into the foothills, armed only with a compass and a sense of adventure.
Similarly, students need to learn how to manipulate symbols in order
to do real mathematics, and that
takes practice.
There are better ways to practice than looking at shrubs.
But the real problem is that *the scrubland never ends*, and what
appear to be features on the horizon are just shrubs of a different
colour.
They drill in order to keep drilling.

The truth is that scrubland is easy for everyone but the students.
You don't need to be a good hiker to guide a class through the
scrubland, and if you want to write a textbook, just "shrubbify" and
fill the book with barcode variants of the same problem.
But the responsibility for getting us out of the scrubland doesn't lie
with teachers, or even textbook writers, but the people who write the curriculum.
And from their perspective, it's much easier to maintain the
scrubland, and maybe ride around in a pickup truck painting shrubs different
colours, than to chart a new course into the mathematical world.
That would take time, money, and vision, and these are perennially in
short supply.

But good mathematical skills are important to society as a whole.
I'm not talking about basic numeracy, e.g. the ability to calculate a
tip or scale up a recipe.
I'm talking about dealing with the ongoing effects of climate change,
big data, artificial intelligence, or personalised medicine, issues which
call for explorers with higher-order hiking skills and a taste for the unknown.
The stakes couldn't be higher.
Curriculum writers need to get out of their pickup trucks,
drop their paintbrushes, and start talking to professionals, people who
know the landscape and use the trails.
Together, they can move mathematics out of the scrubland, and into the 21st
century with all its challenges and complexities.

#### The evidence <a id="sec-1-4" name="sec-1-4"></a>

In the US, the
[Common Core](http://www.corestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/Math_Standards1.pdf) math standards
represent a major effort at curricular reform, though the notion of
"real world problem" being used here does not seem to correspond to
what people ordinarily mean by "real world".
The [Australian Council for Education Research](https://www.acer.org/au/) is
[aware of issues with STEM education](https://research.acer.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&context=policy_analysis_misc),
but the vagueness of the 2018 recommendations suggests that curricular
change is a ways off.

UNFINISHED

## Roads to beauty <a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

To conclude my little manifesto, I want to suggest two directions out of the scrubland.
I will give concrete examples, based on the (randomly selected)
snippet of calculus above.
This is a final year topic, and my examples will be designed for final
year students.
To provide evidence that the simple-minded approach of making maths
interesting works for other grade levels, I'll give a supplementary
set of examples for trigonometry.

The first direction is *pure mathematics*, towards
abstraction, generalisation, proof, and most importantly, *beauty*.
Aesthetic considerations are famously important to pure mathematicians.
The philosopher Bertrand Russell said that pure maths had a "beauty cold
and austere, like that of sculpture", and was "capable of a stern
perfection such as only the greatest art can show".
English mathematician G. H. Hardy elevated this to a *requirement*,
stating that "beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world
for ugly mathematics."

Sound like any high school maths class you ever took?
It's almost as if people got the Hardy quote backwards: there seems to
be no permanent place in the classroom for *beautiful* mathematics.
Let me show you what passes for pure mathematics in our advanced
textbook:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/specialist2.png"
    width="75%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Painting shrubs blue.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

This looks different from the earlier patch of scrubland until you
notice these are more or less the *same* questions with letters
replacing numbers. The shrubs are painted blue, but they are still shrubs.
Instead of dressing up shrubs, we should find a mountain to scale.
Now, some mountains can only be scaled by professionals.
But we don't always need to scale a mountain to appreciate important
results; with a bit of ingenuity, we can usually find a nearby hill
with a gentler slope and a partial view of the summit.

In pure mathematics, mountains are things like theorems (important
proven results), conjectures (important unproven results), and non-trivial examples.
"Important" and "non-trivial" mean a variety of things, but as Hardy and
Russell suggest, *beauty* is perhaps the principal criteria.
Beauty in maths, as in art, is subjective, so we are left the enviable
task of choosing *multiple beautiful things* for students to look at.
Hopefully one of them sticks!

#### Example: the mean value theorem <a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a>

Our first mountain will be the *mean value theorem* (MVT).
Instead of scaling the mountain and giving a fully rigorous proof, we
will content ourselves with a good prospect from lower elevations, in
the form of a *visual proof*.
Suppose we have a function $f(x)$ defined for $a \leq x \leq b$.
This is pictured on the Cartesian plane below.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt1.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Graphing a function $f(x)$ for $a \leq x
    \leq b$.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Now draw a line between the endpoints of the graph.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt2.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Drawing a line (purple) between the endpoints
    of the graph.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

What happens if we shift the purple line (without tilting) up or down?
In this example, there are two shifts where the line *just touches* (is tangent to)
the curve.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt3v2.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>There are two points at which the line just
    touches the curve.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Is it possible to draw a different graph so the purple line is tangent
at *one* point?
If you give students some time to experiment, they should find
examples like the following:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt4.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>An example where the purple line is tangent
    at a single point.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

What about *no points* where the graphs are tangent?
With some time to play around, students should come to doubt that such
curves exist.
How can they prove it?
One approach lies in the definition of "just touching".
Imagine zooming in infinitely close to the point of tangency, so the blue curve becomes
straight (more or less what we mean by the derivative).
You can convince students that the blue and purple lines
must have the *same slope* at this point of intersection.
If they had different slopes, they would cross each other rather than
being tangent!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt5.png"
    width="35%" />
		    <figcaption><i>At infinite magnification, the purple and
    blue lines must coincide.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
</figure>

This suggests a visual proof, which students could discover for
themselves with a little guidance.
First of all, it's clear that some of the blue curve should lie above
the purple line, or below the purple line, otherwise it *is* the
purple line and we have (infinitely) many points of tangency.
But let's assume that some of the blue curve lies below the original
purple line.
Now, move the purple line down until it can't go further without
missing the blue curve altogether.
If the purple line wasn't tangent to the blue at this extreme point,
the blue would cross *through* the purple and we could continue moving
it down.
From our earlier discussion, this means they have to be tangent!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt6.png"
    width="65%" />
		    <figcaption><i>A visual proof that
    the translated purple line is tangent to the blue curve.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Since the purple line is straight, we can easily calculate
its slope:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
$$

For a function $f(x)$ on $a\leq x \leq b$, there is a point $c$ where
the derivative equals the "mean" slope between its endpoints:

$$
f'(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.
$$

This statement is the MVT!
A nice feature of our proof is that (combined with root-finding
methods) it can be turned into an algorithm for finding the point $c$.

#### A kink in the argument <a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a>

As fun as this theorem is to prove, it's even more fun to break.
If the students draw a sharp kink in the curve, they should see that the theorem fails:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt7.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>The proof fails for "kinks".</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Although the blue curve lies entirely on one side of the
purple line, the two never coincide, even when we zoom in.
Put a different way, since the tangent to the blue curve isn't even
well-defined, it cannot equal the purple line!
This places an important technical condition on the mean value
theorem: at every point, the curve must be differentiable, aka
*straight at infinite zoom*.

We could leave it there, but for kicks, let's try and *maximally
break* the theorem.
In the single-kink case, we can simply shift on the endpoints to
define the function on a subinterval $a' \leq x \leq b'$ where the
mean value theorem *does* hold. We just avoid the kink!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt8.png"
    width="60%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Shifting an endpoint to avoid the kink.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

So here is the challenge: draw (or otherwise define) a curve where the
mean value theorem is not applicable in any subinterval.
Since we can apply the theorem whenever we can select a subinterval
without kinks, we need *every subinterval to contain a kink* to make
them unavoidable.
In technical parlance, we need the kinks to be dense.

It's hard to imagine (or draw) such an infinitely jittery curve.
But it's easier if we proceed step-by-step.
First, let's set $a = 0$ and $b= 1$; we lose nothing by making this
choice, since we can always scale and shift our answer to recover the
result for an arbitrary interval $[a, b]$.
Let's start with a trangle-shaped function with a single kink at $x = 1/2$.
We can apply the MVT to any subinterval to the left of the midpoint,
or the right of the midpoint.
Call this a *good subinterval*.
For this triangle function, good intervals have maximum length $1/2$.

Our strategy will be to try gradually reducing the maximum length of
good subintervals until they disappear altogether!
For instance, we can introduce kinks at $x = 1/4, 3/4$ so that the
maximum length is $1/4$.
A simple way to do this is to *scale down* the triangle function by a
factor of 2, put two copies side by side, and add them to the big
triangle, depicted below.
We label steps in the process by $n$, with $n = 0$ the big triangle
with a single kink, and $n = 1$ the sum of big triangle and two
smaller triangles.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/mvt9.png"
    width="80%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Iteratively cooking a blancmange. The
    previous iteration is light green, the triangles we are adding are
    blue, and the sum is full green.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Similarly, to obtain the $n = 2$ curve, we scale down the big triangle
by a factor of $4 = 2^2$, and place $4$ copies side by side, before
adding to the $n = 1$ result.
Now the maximum length of a good subinterval is $2^{-2} = 1/4$.
We can continue in this fashion, iteratively building up what is
called the *blancmange function*, since it resembles the jellied
mounds of the French dessert.
At step $n$, we shrink the original triangle by a factor of $2^n$,
spam $2^n$ copies, and add them to the results of the previous step.

Good subintervals have maximum length $2^{-n}$.
As $n$ gets larger and larger, this length shrinks, and in the limit
$n \to \infty$, they cannot have any length at all.
This shows, informally, that *there are no good subintervals* if we
allow the blancmange-cooking process to go forever.
A neat way of seeing this is by labelling the kinks with their binary
notation.
The first kink (for $n = 0$) is at $x = 0.1$.
The kinks for $n = 1$ (including the middle kink) are at $x
= 0.01, 0.10, 0.11$.
The kinks for $n= 2$ (including the $n = 1$ kinks) are at

$$
n = 0.001, 0.010, 0.011, 0.100, 0.101, 0.110, 0.111.
$$

You get the idea: at stage $n$, there are kinks at all numbers $x\in
(0, 1)$ with binary expansions of length $n+1$.
In the limit $n \to \infty$, there will be a kink at every number $x
\in (0,1)$ with a finite binary expansion, i.e. *every rational
number*.
The rational numbers are indeed dense in the reals.

UNIFNISHED
One final technical point is whether it makes sense to take the limit
$n \to \infty$.
You can run a computer program, which convincingly demonstrates that
the program converges; for more advanced students, a quick technical
argument from the geometric series and the comparison test (which I
will omit here) shows both pointwise and uniform convergence.

## Extra

Sure, you can't hike without walking, and you need plenty of practice
if you want to become a good hiker.
The best way to bring students along is to provide motivation, to
provide interest, and to empower them.

Hopefully, by now you've realised this is a thinly veiled analogy for
maths class.
For so many students, it feels like a pointless trudge through a
landscape without interest, without life, which is stuck in the
scrubland, with a guide who can't explain where they're going or why
they're doing it.
I know because that was my experience in high school.

Of course, this is a thinly veiled analogy to high school maths class.
Doing maths, by itself, for itself, is not intrinsically interesting
to most people.
Just like walking, it can get boring quickly.
And hours of math drill, every day, every week, for years, seems like
overkill to develop basic numeracy.
When was the last time you used the quadratic formula on your tax
return?
Or trigonometry to assess the merits of a lease-purchase scheme?
My point is not that trigonometry or the quadratic formula are
useless, but that the stated aim of basic numeracy doesn't match what
we teach in the curriculum.
Clearly, there's some other value system at play.

The teacher is going to find it hard to justify.

We would have less carbon dioxide in the air, and perhaps our
culture would be less frantic, less shallow, and more curious.
But if we wanted more people to walk, hiking class

Let's say the teacher is an avid hiker.
Why do they like hiking?
Maybe it's the chance to commune with nature, or to get away from the
bustle of every life.
Perhaps it's the lure of exploration, or the call of that mountain
summit in the distance.
Whatever it is, when a students asks: why are we doing this?

And the students could legitimately object that in the future, I'm just
going to be walking from my house to the my car.
Why do I need to spend hours doing this each week?
Heck, I'm going to avoid jobs that require a lot of walking.

They plan to walk from the house to the car, and from the car to work,
and maybe take the dog around the block every now and again.
A job that requires hours of walking? No thank you!

Without the longer classes, schools
will not produce walkers of the calibre needed to fill those
roles. There are good economic reasons, in this case, to provide
students with opportunities to develop advanced hiking skills.

There may also be benefits to a society where more people hike for
fun. For instance, it would reduce carbon emissions, and might make
for a less frantic, more contemplative culture. This involves some
value judgements, but teachers and curricular authorities are in the
position to make this, and make similar judgements when they put
Shakespeare on the syllabus.

We need to change hiking classes so that walks go through interesting
terrain, from meadows to swamps and valleys to forests; at first, along the comfortable and well-trodden routes. But
by degrees, they should conquer summits, explore uncharted wastes, and
camp in the wilderness.
At the end of the day, hiking is not about the act of walking, but a
way to experience the world. The walking is a means to this end. And
the class will remain a dead letter, pure trudgery, until it gets out
of the scrubland and owns its purpose.

Would you blame most students for losing interest and lagging behind,
and later identifying as people who hated hiking?
Of course not!

Unless they are taught to love hiking, they'll have no thought of
walking for hours every day.
Not to mention if it becomes a joyless chore, in which case they'll do
everything they can to avoid it!

Perhaps, also, there are general cultural benefits when everyone
enjoys hiking, for instance, a higher level of average physical fitness, or a
closer connection to nature.

That makes it easier to motivate the whole enterprise, and less likely
to lead to resentment.

Not everywhere can be reached by car.

These natural walkers trudge without complaint, they have stamina,
they have grit.
But sometimes they trudge without purpose, almost too willing to
follow the path, or the teacher, gazing contentedly at their own feet.
These people may make the best hikers, who knows?
But it is more credible that people

At the end of the day, hiking is not about the act of walking itself,
which can be pure drudgery, but rather, to use walking as a way of experiencing
the world.

Perambulatory parable

And these hiking classes will remain a dead letter until they get out
of the scrubland and own their purpose.


Do we really expect them to become devotees of the deductive method

Of course, there will be people who naturally love Euclid.
But proving facts about plane figures leaves most of us cold.

The first is to lower our ambitions and go on short walks.
The connection between practice and real life is then clear, and less
likely to lead to resentment; the teacher can justify the whole
enterprise.

If we lower our sights, society as a whole could lose out.

Perhaps, then, we should restrict hiking classes to those who naturally enjoy
walking and don't mind the drudgery.

These people, one could reason, will obviously become the best hikers.
We can get them running laps through the scrubland and they'll love it!
But is it true that they'll become the best hikers?

be great hikers, if only they developed the walking skills.

Really, we should *make things interesting*, and let the students
decide for themselves whether they want to hike.
This is the solution the astute reader will have guessed immediately.

act of walking, but rather, using walking to

What if, by restricting our attention to natural walkers, we
miss out on a huge pool of talent, namely those with the potential to
be great hikers if they practice walking?

For most people, this is not an intrisically interesting activity.
In fact, it's particularly boring for mathematicians!
This is because maths is not walking; it's hiking.
It's a way of encountering and understanding and exploring the world
using formal systems.
But maths curricula, at least in Australia and North
America, insist on marching students through the scrubland.

Both of these solutions are unsatisfying because the answer is obvious.

meadows, into forests, along streams and canyons.

This would not only turn natural walkers into good hikers, but
identify others with hiking talent who need more motivation.

The greatest success, in this new paradigm, would be the moment a
student realised that hiking was not about walking, but rather, using
walking to experience and understand the world.

I'm going to pick on an Australian textbook for the most advanced high
school subject.
But, in its defense, all of the textbooks are like this.

But this all depends on whether walking is a skill that can be developed.
If so, then by focusing on natural walkers, we lose access to a huge
pool of talent, namely those with the potential to be great hikers
if only they had the motivation to walk.

The scrubland is an empty philosophy.
We are best served, as individuals and as a society, by showing
students that hiking is not about walking, but rather, using
walking to experience and understand the world.

Walking takes you to interesting places, if you do some planning and
follow your nose.

We should take them through varied and stimulating terrain, into
forests, along streams, down canyons, and up slopes.


Perhaps, then, we should focus on training *natural walkers*
those who walk tirelessly and without complaint through the scrubland.

But maths curricula, at least in Australia and North
America, insist on marching students through the scrubland, turning

These are repetitive, mindless, plug-and-chug problems, and students are
forced to do hundreds of them.

I don't know about you, but these problems fill me with existential horror.
Why do I care about the derivative of $\sin^{-1}(5x/4)$?
Let alone its second derivative?
What is this for?
Why am I doing any of this?
Why am I even here?
This is what I mean by the scrubland.
There are no landmarks, nothing for the eye to latch onto, just an
endless plain of withered, ankle-height shrubs.

Maybe there are some landmarks in the distance after all, once we get past
the dead shrubs.
What could they look like?

hike into the foothills, armed
only with a compass and a sense of adventure.

There are two directions we could go, which reflect the structure of
mathematics itself.

Perhaps we should show our students some beautiful mathematics.
In my analogy, this could a mountain peak with a particularly glorious view of sunrise.
You need to be a good walker to get there, and the trail may wind
through some shrubby foothills.
More generally, pure mathematicians are like Indiana Jones, venturing
into trackless realms and finding objects of great beauty, before,
almost as an afterthought, bringing them back to civilisation.
This is an activity we should be modelling and advertising and making accessible.


But this is not what happens.
Here's an example of what passes for pure mathematics in our "advanced" textbook:

This is more scrubland, but the shrubs are coloured differently.
There is nothing beautiful about these results, nothing surprising.
They are presented as brute formal facts, with no aesthetic value.

These sort of look like the other problems; in fact, I have a sneaking
suspicion that they are *exactly* the same, but they've replaced numbers with
letters.
These are just shrubs of a different color.

Once again, there is some conventional wisdom at work here.
Students find proofs hard.
If you've ever tried to teach Euclid at a high school level, as many
countries do, you might have noticed this.
You feel like a dentist.
But I don't think it's because proofs are inherently difficult.
Rather, I think it's because throwing Euclid at them, without any
preparation, is a terrible idea.
Most people are not excited by sundry factoids about triangles.
It's a steep learning curve if you don't care about what's at the top
of the hill.

So we need to teach proofs better.
We need to use examples which pique student interest, and teach them
how to reason mathematically step by step.
Start with examples, visual proofs, intuition pumps, heuristics, and
judiciously cut corners.
If you start with Euclid's axioms, that's probably where the student's
relationship with the deductive method is going to end.

We don't usually need to scale the mountain to appreciate some of what
makes these things beautiful.
If the mountain is too steep, find a nearby hill with a gentler slope
and a partial view of the summit.

you could either tell the students, or
let them discover (with some prompting) for themselves.

This is a beautiful result, which is within the means of ordinary
students to discover for themselves with some judicious guidance.
It illustrates some basic principles of mathematical reasoning ---
play, building intuition from examples, induction from the specific to
the general, posing and answering questions.
The proof appears as a sort of *mechanism* which takes any input and
guarantees a tangency point as output.
(The idea that a proof treats an *infinite* number of examples is, I
think, a good way to introduce it in these contexts.)

Conventional wisdom states that students
need to master basic skills by drill before they can move on to more
interesting tasks.
This sounds reasonable, and I'll come back to drill below, but one can
ask: what are the landmarks they're meant to hike towards, now that
they differentiate inverse sine with their eyes closed?

That's the end of my little preamble, and by now you've probably realised
that I'm not really talking about hiking. I'm
talking about *maths*.
In this thinly-veiled analogy, walking is the ability to manipulate
symbols, to follow rules, to find your way around a formal structure.

Mathematics has its own world, a vast topography of features and
landforms, that can only be traversed and navigated by manipulating
symbols; but manipulating symbols is not itself the goal.

To help convey this boredom, let me give you a
snapshot of the scrubland.

There are two different paths heading off into the
mathematical landscape.

it's easy to generate minor variants of the same
question, the same two or three ideas, and make that a chapter of your
textbook.

It's true that students need to practice symbol manipulation somehow,
and I'll say more below about how to do that in a way that doesn't
inspire existential horror.

The traditional claim that students
need to drill in order to *get somewhere interesting* is usually made in bad
faith.

You can take anything and shrubbify it, because all you do is generate
minor variants of the same problem.
Find 15 distinct problems, and you have yourself a textbook.

and a lot of
collaboration with the professional navigators, people who know the
landscape and use the trails.

It looks like we need to prepare some students to do advanced hiking.
But if most students hate walking through scrubland, maybe we should
restrict advanced classes to those who enjoy it, the "natural walkers"
who trudge tirelessly and without complaint for hours.

Mathematics has its own world, a vast topography of features and
landforms that must be traversed by manipulating
symbols, but manipulating symbols is not itself the goal.

I scraped by with passes, but I didn't understand or care about it.

Here are some calculus exercises from a popular Australian textbook for the
most advanced maths class.

two different roads winding off into the mathematical distance.

I mean, what is inverse sine on a Saturday?
Could I get a beer with it?

But wait a second!
Conventional pedagogical wisdom tells us that drill is
necessary to develop basic walking skills, for students to find their
feet before they walk off into the foothills.
Maybe we can disagree about the best way to learn to walk, but the
bottom line is that if students *never get anywhere*, this claim is made
in bad faith.

Or would you have lost interest, and started lagging behind?

There are a few different ways we could fix this situation.
The first is to make the connection between practice and real life closer,
exchanging hikes for small, unambitious strolls.

But what if a whole sector of the economy
depends on advanced hiking skills?

If we lower our sights, everyone loses.

Perhaps we should restrict classes to the "natural walkers", the
students who trudge tirelessly and without complaint through the scrubland.
They appear to have the most potential.
But what if walking is a skill that can be *developed*, rather than a
natural ability, like double-jointedness, you're either born with or not?
If so, then just taking natural walkers cuts us off from a huge reservoir of
talent: the students who could become good hikers if they were motivated to walk.

There is a simple way to develop good hikers and maximise access to
talent: stop marching students through the scrubland!
We should take them through varied and stimulating terrain, into the
forest, or towards
the strange rock formations in the distance.
At first, lessons would be along well-marked trails, but with time,
they could learn to camp in the wilderness, explore uncharted wastes
and conquer summits.
This would turn natural walkers into good hikers, and bring others
along who may, with practice, become just as good or better.
By taking them on real hikes, students would learn that hiking is not
about the act of walking, but rather *using walking* to experience and
understand the world.

I don't debate this, though I think there are better ways to do it
than walking through scrubland, and a lot of newfangled pedagogy is
focused on trying to make this process more engaging and inclusive.

So where does this claim come form?

There is nothing beautiful or deep here, just the same manipulations
in disguise!
It is the wrong sort of generalisation.

What should be a voyage of discovery and empowerment, a journey into
the mathematical world, is a joyless plod for most students.

In other words, these hiking classes effectively kill interest in hiking.

For a fuller discussion of the role of aesthetics in mathematics, see
for instance
["Aesthetic Considerations in Mathematics" (2011)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c01f/1b7cdbe2b9a649d09311f7b3e5e1bcb88310.pdf) by Nathalie Sinclair.

In this slightly tortured analogy, 

(I'm hoping this is starting to ring bells, but let's continue with
the fable.)

I want you to imagine a reality, not so different from our own, where
you were forced to take *hiking classes* in high school.

(In fact, it seemed like a sort of toy version of philosophy where
everything really obeyed its definition.)

If classes are boring, the only people to stick around will
be the ones who naturally love walking, who trudge
tirelessly and without complaint across miles of scrubland.

we should stop marching student through the scrubland, even if that's
what's been done for time immemorial.

At first, hikes would be along well-marked trails, but with time,
they could learn to camp in the wilderness, explore uncharted wastes
and conquer summits.

But that's how they'd been doing things forever, so that's the way
things were.

That's what *hiking* (as opposed to *walking*) should be about.

If classes are boring, only the kids with endurace and a natural yen
for walking will stick around.
And many teachers will say: good!
These are the students with talent and real potential for hiking.
But walking is a skill that be developed, and if hiking looks like
fun, it will motivate students to get better at walking.
And what do you know?
The pool of talent feeding into our hiking sector just got a lot
bigger, the pipeline less leaky.
Everyone wins.

The way to fix these classes, and make hiking fun, is obvious:
we should stop marching student through the scrubland, even if that is
what tradition dictates.

To help make the problem more vivid, and its solution clearer,
consider an analogy to *hiking*.

But what if we were to learn that walking was a skill that could be
developed, and natural ability mattered much less than the
motivation to develop it?
What if studies revealed that most of these "natural walkers" had
pivotal experiences of non-scrubland hiking?

We would stop dividing the class into those with and without ability,
but rather, those with and without *interest*, since we would see that
this is the primary determinant of walking skill.

By going on real hikes, students would discover that hiking is not
about the act of walking, but rather using walking to experience and
understand a world rich in wonder.

And they don't need to become a professional hiker to enjoy the odd
stroll, any more than they need to be a professional writer to read
the odd book.


Put a different way, the mathematical world, with its vast topography
of features and landforms, must be traversed by manipulating symbols,
but manipulating symbols is not itself the goal.

I know because that was my experience in high school.
I was not a natural symbol manipulator, and scraped by with passes
until learning that maths could be *used* for things.

Let's look at an example.
These calculus exercises are taken from a popular Australian textbook.
Calculus is, without exaggeration, one of the great landmarks of human thought.
What does the textbook make of it?

That's how indistinguishable and repetitive these questions are.

In a way, it's perversely impressive how these textbooks take a
milestone of Western thought and "shrubbify" it.

I mean, what is inverse sine on a Saturday?
I may as well be looking at a barcode.

The topic, calculus, is like a jewelled diamond in a precision watch:
both gorgeous and supremely useful.

But they also fill me with existential horror.

Perhaps I'm being unfair.
First of all, you might say it's the role of the teacher to enliven the lesson, to
provide context and motivation.
But if these aren't hardcoded into the curriculum and the textbooks,
then every class with a teacher who is inexperienced, underqualified,
or lazy, gets shortchanged.
It's a recipe for massive inequality.
Spicing up the textbook won't solve this problem, but it can alleviate it.

A second objects is that students need to walk before they can hike,
or in mathematical terms, to become handy symbol manipulators before
they can do real maths.
There are better ways to do this than looking at shrubs.
But the real problem is that *the scrubland never ends*.
What appear to be features on the horizon are just shrubs of a
different colour.
And if students *never get anywhere*, the claim that they have to
drill, before they can go somewhere interesting, is made in bad faith.
They drill in order to keep drilling.

This is the sad reality underneath a lot of conventional wisdom.

Physically drawing the curve, it seems impossible to avoid graphs a
finite number of kinks connected by short smooth segments ("piecewise
differentiable").
But we can proceed by steps.

This will maximally break the theorem in the sense that it holds for *no
subinterval* of $[a, b]$.
