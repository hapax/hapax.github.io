**August 13, 2019.** *A manifesto on maths education.*

## A preamble

I want you to imagine a reality, not so different from our own, where
you were forced to take *hiking classes* in high school.
Every day, for a couple of hours, you and your classmates would trudge
through a featureless scrubland, with no views, no
peaks, and no apparent goal other than the hike itself.
If the class complained that the walk was boring and pointless, the
teacher would reply, somewhat defensively, that walking was an important life
skill you needed to get by as an adult.
Heck, if you can't walk, how do you expect to get a job!

Would you have enjoyed this hiking class?
Or, more likely, would you have lost interest, and started lagging behind?
Maybe in time you would even come to proudly identify as someone who
sucked at hiking and hated it.
The problem with the class is obvious.
For most people, walking is not an intrinsically interesting
activity.
There needs to be some motivation to walk, something to walk towards
or to look at while you walk.
That's the point of a proper hike.
If there's no motivation, it becomes a chore, and rather than being trained to
walk, you will be trained to *avoid walking*.

There are a few different ways to fix the situation.
The first is to lower our ambitions and go on smaller hikes, closer to the
walking students do as adults.
The connection between practice and real life is then clear, and less
likely to lead to resentment; the teacher can justify the exercise.
But what if a whole sector of the economy
depends on advanced hiking skills?
What if we need wayfarers, explorers and hunters?
If we lower our sights, society as a whole could lose out.

Perhaps, then, we should restrict hiking classes to those who naturally enjoy
walking and don't mind the drudgery.
These people, one could reason, will obviously become the best hikers.
We can get them running laps through the scrubland and they'll love it!
But is it true that they'll become the best hikers?
What if walking is a skill that can be developed?
What if, by restricting our attention to these natural walkers, we
miss out on a huge pool of talent, those who have the potential to be
great hikers, if only they developed the walking skills.

Really, we should *make things interesting*, and let the students
decide for themselves whether they want to hike.
This is the solution the astute reader will have guessed immediately.
If you want to make the classes good, you need to hike through interesting terrain, through meadows and swamps,
into valleys and up mountains, at dawn and sunset when the prospects are good.
At first, hikes would be along the comfortable and well-trodden routes,
while students found their feet and developed confidence, but
with time, by degrees, they could learn to camp in the wilderness,
to explore uncharted wastes and conquer summits.
They would learn that, at the end of the day, hiking was not about the
act of walking, but rather, using walking to
experience the world.

## A scrubland specimen

You've probably realised by now that I'm not talking about hiking, I'm
talking about *maths education*.
In this thinly-veiled analogy, walking is the ability to manipulate
symbols, to follow rules, to play with formal structures.
For most people, this is not an intrisically interesting activity.
For most mathematicians, it's particularly boring!
This is because maths is not walking; it's hiking.
It's a way of encountering and understanding and exploring the world
using formal systems.
But maths curricula, at least in Australia and North
America, insist on marching students through the scrubland.

#### Dead shrubs

In case you think I'm being bombastic, let me give you a snapshot.
I'm going to pick on an Australian textbook for the most advanced high
school subject.
But, in its defense, all of the textbooks are like this.
The following exercises are from the section on rates of change:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/specialist1.png"
    width="75%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Dead shrubs in the scrubland.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

These are completely formal, plug-and-chug problems, and students are
forced to do hundreds of them.

I don't know about you, but these problems fill me with a sort of
existential horror.
Why do I care about the derivative of $\sin^{-1}(5x/4)$?
Let alone its second derivative?
Why am I doing any of this?
Why am I here?
This is what I mean by the scrubland.
It's an endless plain of withered, ankle-height shrubs.
There are no landmarks, nothing for the eye to latch onto.

#### Beautiful landmarks

Now, conventional wisdom states that students need to master basic
skills, through drill, before they can go to do interesting things.
Maybe there are some landmarks in the distance after all, once we get past
the dead shrubs.
What could they look like?

There are two directions we could go, which reflect the structure of
mathematics itself.
The first direction is *pure* mathematics, which is all about
playing with formal structures and discovering their
properties.
This is the realm of abstraction, of generalisation, of
proof, and most importantly, of beauty.
Aesthetic consideration are famously important to pure mathematicians.
The philosopher Bertrand Russell said that pure maths had a "beauty cold
and austere, like that of sculpture", and was "capable of a stern
perfection such as only the greatest art can show".
Along similar lines, the English mathematician G. H. Hardy said
"beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world
for ugly mathematics."

Perhaps we should show our students some beautiful mathematics.
In my analogy, this could a mountain peak with a particularly glorious view of sunrise.
You need to be a good walker to get there, and the trail may wind
through some shrubby foothills.
More generally, pure mathematicians are like Indiana Jones, venturing
into trackless realms and finding objects of great beauty, before,
almost as an afterthought, bringing them back to civilisation.
This is an activity we should be modelling and advertising and making accessible.

But this is not what happens.
Here's an example of what passes for pure mathematics in our advanced textbook:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/specialist2.png"
    width="75%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Mountain or scrubland?</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

This is more scrubland, just with shrubs of a different colour.
There is nothing beautiful about these results; there is nothing
surprising.
They have no aesthetic value.

#### Useful landmarks

A second type of landmark is 

## The role of the teacher

## Extra

Sure, you can't hike without walking, and you need plenty of practice
if you want to become a good hiker.
The best way to bring students along is to provide motivation, to
provide interest, and to empower them.

Hopefully, by now you've realised this is a thinly veiled analogy for
maths class.
For so many students, it feels like a pointless trudge through a
landscape without interest, without life, which is stuck in the
scrubland, with a guide who can't explain where they're going or why
they're doing it.
I know because that was my experience in high school.

Of course, this is a thinly veiled analogy to high school maths class.
Doing maths, by itself, for itself, is not intrinsically interesting
to most people.
Just like walking, it can get boring quickly.
And hours of math drill, every day, every week, for years, seems like
overkill to develop basic numeracy.
When was the last time you used the quadratic formula on your tax
return?
Or trigonometry to assess the merits of a lease-purchase scheme?
My point is not that trigonometry or the quadratic formula are
useless, but that the stated aim of basic numeracy doesn't match what
we teach in the curriculum.
Clearly, there's some other value system at play.

The teacher is going to find it hard to justify.

We would have less carbon dioxide in the air, and perhaps our
culture would be less frantic, less shallow, and more curious.
But if we wanted more people to walk, hiking class

Let's say the teacher is an avid hiker.
Why do they like hiking?
Maybe it's the chance to commune with nature, or to get away from the
bustle of every life.
Perhaps it's the lure of exploration, or the call of that mountain
summit in the distance.
Whatever it is, when a students asks: why are we doing this?

And the students could legitimately object that in the future, I'm just
going to be walking from my house to the my car.
Why do I need to spend hours doing this each week?
Heck, I'm going to avoid jobs that require a lot of walking.

They plan to walk from the house to the car, and from the car to work,
and maybe take the dog around the block every now and again.
A job that requires hours of walking? No thank you!

Without the longer classes, schools
will not produce walkers of the calibre needed to fill those
roles. There are good economic reasons, in this case, to provide
students with opportunities to develop advanced hiking skills.

There may also be benefits to a society where more people hike for
fun. For instance, it would reduce carbon emissions, and might make
for a less frantic, more contemplative culture. This involves some
value judgements, but teachers and curricular authorities are in the
position to make this, and make similar judgements when they put
Shakespeare on the syllabus.

We need to change hiking classes so that walks go through interesting
terrain, from meadows to swamps and valleys to forests; at first, along the comfortable and well-trodden routes. But
by degrees, they should conquer summits, explore uncharted wastes, and
camp in the wilderness.
At the end of the day, hiking is not about the act of walking, but a
way to experience the world. The walking is a means to this end. And
the class will remain a dead letter, pure trudgery, until it gets out
of the scrubland and owns its purpose.

Would you blame most students for losing interest and lagging behind,
and later identifying as people who hated hiking?
Of course not!

Unless they are taught to love hiking, they'll have no thought of
walking for hours every day.
Not to mention if it becomes a joyless chore, in which case they'll do
everything they can to avoid it!

Perhaps, also, there are general cultural benefits when everyone
enjoys hiking, for instance, a higher level of average physical fitness, or a
closer connection to nature.

That makes it easier to motivate the whole enterprise, and less likely
to lead to resentment.

Not everywhere can be reached by car.

These natural walkers trudge without complaint, they have stamina,
they have grit.
But sometimes they trudge without purpose, almost too willing to
follow the path, or the teacher, gazing contentedly at their own feet.
These people may make the best hikers, who knows?
But it is more credible that people

At the end of the day, hiking is not about the act of walking itself,
which can be pure drudgery, but rather, to use walking as a way of experiencing
the world.

Perambulatory parable

And these hiking classes will remain a dead letter until they get out
of the scrubland and own their purpose.
