## Introduction

If physics is to be believed, there is nothing special about the
present.
"Right now" is similar to the statement "right here", but it refers to
*when* the speaker is.
But what is privileged about the moment of utterance?
Is it any more privileged than the bath tub or the park next to the
subway where the speaker happens to declare they are located?
In physical terms, the "present" is just a projection function on
spacetime coordinates,

$$
(t, x, y, z) \mapsto t.
$$

On the other hand, time *feels* different from space.
Unlike space, where I can travel at will between the park and the
bath tub, I cannot choose to return to last Tuesday.
We seem to go in one direction through time, at a fixed speed.
Of course, physics does not contradict this.
Relativity teaches us that time is, indeed, different from space, and
closely bound up with *causation*.
Since we experience things in causal order, the unidirectionality is
necessary.

But there is more to the peculiar psychology of the present.
Stranger still than being unable to control our motion along $t$,
there is the sensation of *being in a particular moment*.
Which moment we are "in" seems to changed at some fixed rate, a kind
of "shifting window" which is not, prima facie, dictated by physics.
In the face of these sensations, it is tempting to argue that our *qualia* are
bound to the present moment in special ways, and they show,
incorrigibly, that there is something special about *now*.

I think there are some serious explanatory problems here, real
quandaries about the psychology of time that folk wisdom highlights,
and that philosophers have not done a good job of explaining (to my knowledge).
I will argue that the resolution lies in carefully considering what a
person is, what time is, and what causation is.
In many ways, this is analogous to solving Zeno's *arrow
paradox*, where we must explain what properties of the time slice of a
moving arrow explain its motion.
