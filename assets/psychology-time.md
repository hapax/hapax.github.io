## Introduction

If physics is to be believed, there is nothing special about the
present.
"Right now" is similar to the statement "right here", but it refers to
*when* the speaker is.
But what is privileged about the moment of utterance?
Is it any more privileged than the bath tub or the park next to the
subway where the speaker happens to declare they are located?
In physical terms, the "present" is just a projection function on
spacetime coordinates,

$$
(t, x, y, z) \mapsto t.
$$

But surely there is more to than that.
Time *feels* different from space.
Unlike space, where I can travel at will between the park and the
bath tub, I cannot choose to return to last Tuesday.
We seem to go in one direction through time, at a fixed speed.
Physics does not contradict this.
Relativity teaches us that time is, indeed, different from space.
In particular, *causation* can only go in one direction.
Since we experience things in causal order, this must be the case.

But there is more to the peculiar psychology of the present than our
inability to return to the past.
There is the sensation of *being in a particular moment* and *that
moment changing*.
This "shifting window" is not, prima facie, dictated by physics.
One might be tempted to argue that our sensations, our *qualia*, are
bound to the present moment in special ways, that these sensations
show, incorrigibly, that there is something special about *now*.

I think there are, at least, some serious explanatory problems here,
some real quandaries about the psychology of time that folk wisdom
points to.
But the resolution, I will argue, lies in carefully considering what a
person is, what time is, and what causation is.
In many ways, the solution will be analogous to Zeno's *arrow
paradox*, where we are required to explain what properties of the
arrow's time slice explain its motion.
No fancy new tools are required, just clear and careful application of things we know.
