**February 5, 2021.** *Some brief musings on the structure of unitary orbits
  for density matrices.*

#### Introduction

The [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere)
represents the space of pure states on a single qubit (see also
[this](https://hapax.github.io/physics/mathematics/bloch/) recent
post).
The "Bloch ball" is the space of all *density matrices* on the qubit.
It consists of concentric spheres of
