**February 5, 2021.** *Some brief musings on the structure of unitary orbits
  for density matrices, attempting to generalise the nested spheres of
  the Bloch ball.*

#### Introduction

The [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere)
represents the space of pure states on a single qubit (see also
[this](https://hapax.github.io/physics/mathematics/bloch/) recent
post).
The "Bloch ball" is the space of all *density matrices* on the qubit.
It fills in the Bloch sphere with concentric spheres of increasing
mixedness, and at the centre is the maximally mixed state $I_2/2$,
where $I_n$ will denote the $n \times n$ identity matrix.
The unitary group $\mathrm{U}(2)$
