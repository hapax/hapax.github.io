This is the technical appendix to my
[post on napkin hacks](https://hapax.github.io/physics/teaching/hacks/napkin-hacks/).
It contains solutions to exercises, and some material I deemed overly
technical for the post.
Very much under construction!

*Prerequisites: exponentials; binomial approximation.*

The equilibrium condition for pollen grains is more
complicated than the simple equation I gave in the main text.
If there are many balls of resin, they will settle at different
heights, and the number of particles will change with height.

Nature likes low energy states.
In a hot system, there is an element of randomness, but nature
penalises high energy states by making them exponentially unlikely:

$$
\text{probability}(E) \propto e^{-E/k_B\mathcal{T}}.
$$

They are not exactly zero, but when the energy $E$ is much greater
than the thermal energy $k_B\mathcal{T}$, they may as well be!
For a gas in a tall container, the energy is just the gravitational potential energy, $E
= mgh$, and the number density of particles is proportional to the
probability.
The result is called the *barometric distribution*:

$$
n(h) = n_0 e^{-mgh/k_B\mathcal{T}},
$$

where $n_0$ is a constant (with dimensions of density) that won't concern us.

Consider a thin slice of the fluid at height $h$, with density $n$,
thickness $\Delta h$ and area $A$.
This slice will lose particles as they fall under the influence of
gravity.
In equilibrium, particles fall at the terminal velocity
$v_\text{term}$, and hence the slice loses particles at a rate

$$
R_\text{loss} = n A \Delta h v_\text{term}.
$$

But balls of resin also perform random walks.
They will tend to wander from regions of high concentration to regions
of low concentration, since (as discussed in the main text) a drop of
random walkers spreads out.
Since the layer below will tend to have more resin balls (according to
the barometric distribution), there will be a upward spread of
walkers.
We expect this will involve $\Delta n$, the difference in
number density, and the rate of diffusion $D$.
The rate of gain should then take the form (Exercise A.1)

$$
R_\text{gain} = D A \Delta n.
$$

Finally, in equilibrium, the rate of gain and loss are equal!
Thus, we have that

$$
n A \Delta h v_\text{term} = D A \Delta n \quad \Longrightarrow \quad v_\text{term} = \frac{D}{n}\frac{\Delta n}{\Delta h}.
$$

This looks complicated, but for the barometric distribution (Exercise
A.2), it turns out that

$$
\frac{1}{n}\frac{\Delta n}{\Delta h} = \frac{mg}{k_B\mathcal{T}} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad
v_\text{term}  = \frac{Dmg}{k_B\mathcal{T}}.
$$

If we now plug in the terminal velocity from Stokes' law, we can
rearrange to find the Stokes-Einstein relation we derived (with
considerable trickery) in the main text:

$$
D  = \frac{k_B\mathcal{T}}{6\pi \mu r}.
$$

There are various factors of $2$ I am neglecting.
But given the dimensional analysis-based sloppiness I'm advocating in
general, we won't lose sleep over them!

**Exercise A.1 (grabbing granules).** The rate at which a
  thin slice of fluid gains resin particles, $R_\text{gain}$, will
  involve:
  - The difference in concentration $\Delta n$ between layers.
  - The area $A$ of the layer.
  - The diffusion constant $D$ for resin particles.

The rate $R_\text{gain}$ has dimensions of number per time.
Find the dimensions of the terms in the list above, and conclude from
dimensional analysis that

$$
R_\text{gain} \sim D A \Delta n.
$$

**Exercise A.2 (exponential change).** One way of defining an
exponential is as the limit

$$
e^x = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1 + \frac{x}{n}\right)^n.
$$

The binomial approximation says that

$$
(1 + X)^\alpha \approx 1 + \alpha X
$$

for small $X$ and any $\alpha$.
We can combine these two facts to learn something cool about the
barometric distribution!
