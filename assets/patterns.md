**March ?, 2020.** *Stuff*

Mathematics is the study of patterns.
Physics is the study of patterns in nature.
It is no surprise, then, that the two subjects are deeply intertwined.
But we can think about feature of this relationship in terms of what I
will (half-seriously) call "metapatterns".
These are empirical observations about patterns, both in nature and
studied abstractly, which help explain features of the hard sciences.

### Order and chaos

Humans have long believed in an orderly cosmos, and natural laws
governing cause and effect.
In a sense, even mythology is a search for principles underlying
regularity.
Even if the laws are fanciful, the premise is in fact an empirical
one: there is regularity in the world above and around us.
Things need not have turned out that way.
We could live in a disorderly universe, where "laws" changed from
moment to moment, and patterns vanished the moment they were observed.
But in our universe, even chaos is a highly structured affair.
This leads to our first metapattern:

**Metapattern 1.** Nature is patterned.

It seems, at first, like every branch of observational science is
separate and all things are different.
Nature may be patterned, but perhaps there are too many patterns to
usefully catalogue or transform into a science.
But one of the key lessons of maths and physics is that many patterns
are secretly the same.
Newton saw the same laws governing the motion of the planets and the
fall of an apple.
By labelling points on the plane with $x$ and $y$, Descartes united
algebra and geometry.
This suggests a second metapattern:

**Metapattern 2.** Patterns recur.

To understand what this means, we need to say more about what a
pattern is.

### Pattern-matching

If we could read patterns directly off their manifestations,
recurrence would be a trivial matter.
But the laws of gravitation are not written in the stars, or the arc
of a tennis ball.
