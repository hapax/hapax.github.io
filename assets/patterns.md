## Introduction

Mathematics is the study of patterns.
Physics is the study of patterns in nature.
It is no surprise, then, that the two subjects are deeply intertwined.
But we can think about feature of this relationship in terms of what I
will (half-seriously) call "metapatterns".
These are empirical observations about patterns, both in nature and
studied abstractly, which help explain features of the hard sciences.

Humans have long believed in an orderly cosmos, and natural laws
governing cause and effect.
In a sense, even mythology is a search for principles underlying
regularity.
Even if the laws are fanciful, the premise is in fact an empirical
one: there is regularity in the world above and around us.
Things need not have turned out that way.
We could live in a disorderly universe, where "laws" changed from
moment to moment, and patterns vanished the moment they were observed.
But in our universe, even chaos is a highly structured affair.
This leads to our first metapattern:
