**January 12, 2021.** *In a

  I advanced a four-dimensionalist version of eternal recurrence. I

#### Brainjam

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I argued that it was possible to reconcile four-dimensionalism (a
belief that all times exist) with our seemingly indisputable
experience of being lodged in the present moment.
Put simply, each moment is *always* being experienced, creating a sort
of "brainjam" in which our life is eternally pickled into the
spacetime continuum.
The sense that time passes is (and must be) a cognitive artefact rather than
some incorrigible metaphysical fact.
For arguments in favour of this view, and other elaborations, I refer
to that post.

Here, I just want to focus on a few consequences of this "brainjam"
philosophy.
They are very similar
