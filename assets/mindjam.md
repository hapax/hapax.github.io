**January 12, 2021.** *In a
  [previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
  I advanced a four-dimensionalist version of eternal recurrence. I
  consider some of the moral consequences.*

#### Introduction

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I argued that it was possible to reconcile four-dimensionalism (a
belief that all times exist) with our seemingly indisputable
experience of being lodged in the present moment.
Put simply, each moment is *always* being experienced, creating a sort
of "brainjam" in which our life is eternally pickled into the
spacetime continuum.
The sense that time passes is (and must be) a cognitive artefact rather than
some incorrigible metaphysical fact.
For arguments in favour of this view, and other elaborations, I refer
to that post.
Here, I just want to focus on a few consequences of this "brainjam"
philosophy.

#### Brainjam vs eternal recurrence

First, let's compare it to the doctrine of eternal recurrence: time is
cyclic, and we are doomed to repeat ourselves.
Evidently, this is an archetypal idea, popping up everywhere in
classical antiquity, from Egypt to India, Greece to Mesoamerica.
Cycles have a certain economy of pattern, and even today,
[certain eminences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycles_of_Time)
would like to think of cosmology as being cyclic.

But for all its metaphysical prettiness, recurrence has an important
ethical dimension.
The Stoic [Epitectus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus) taught
a "love of fate", or *amor fati*.
