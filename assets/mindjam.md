**January 13, 2021.** *In a
  [previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
  I advanced a four-dimensionalist version of eternal recurrence. I
  consider some of the moral consequences.*

#### Introduction

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I argued that it was possible to reconcile four-dimensionalism (a
belief that all times exist) with our peculiar experience of time.
Put simply, each moment is *always* being experienced, a sort
of "brainjam" by which our life is pickled into the
spacetime continuum.
The sense that time passes, the impression of sequence, is (and must
be) a cognitive artefact rather than some incorrigible metaphysical fact.
For arguments in favour of this view, and other elaborations, I refer
to that post.
Here, I want to discuss some of the broader philosophical aspects of brainjam.

#### Eternal recurrence and amor fati

We can compare brainjam to the doctrine of eternal recurrence,
the idea that time is cyclic and we are doomed to repeat ourselves.
Evidently, this is an archetypal thought, popping up everywhere in
classical antiquity from Egypt to India, Greece to Mesoamerica.
Cycles have a certain economy of pattern, and even today,
[cyclic views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycles_of_Time)
of the universe remain popular.
For all its metaphysical prettiness, the ethical dimensions of
recurrence are no less important.
The Stoics taught a "love of fate", or *amor fati*. For instance, in
his *Meditations*, Marcus Aurelius writes

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with
whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.
</span>

Almost 2000 years later, Friedrich Nietzsche would turn eternal
recurrence and *amor fati* into an ethic, a
love of reality beyond the stale, life-denying categories of European thought.
<!-- to counterbalance his infamously negative attitudes towards European
morality. -->
*Ecce Homo* states this ethic clearly:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
My formula for greatness in a human being is *amor fati*: that one wants
nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all
eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all
idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love it.
</span>

For Nietzsche, the love of life in all its
supra-moral necessity came first, and eternal recurrence the brilliant
afterthought.
<!--, or rather, of the love of necessity.-->
It was less a metaphysical insight than a moral
thought experiment for guiding one towards a love of fate.
<!-- guiding the individual towards *amor fati*. -->
<!-- Eternal recurrence rather a thought experiment by which to guide the individual towards
*amor fati*.
He equates this with a love of life and a rejection of the milquetoast
religious sensibilities he so detested. 
Whatever the similarities, there are subtle shifts in emphasis that
will lead us away, I think, from the indiscriminate acceptance of
Nietzsche's *amor fati*. -->
But I find Nietzsche's formulas, and the parallel to the Stoics,
ambiguous.
Both made a virtue of necessity.
For the Stoics, however, the emphasis is on the *fati*, the
powerlessness of human beings to intervene in the operation of the
universe.
The *amor* is merely the adaptive reaction.
As Epitectus writes (*Discourses*),

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Being educated is precisely learning to will each thing just as it happens.
</span>
<!-- The Stoics had a bleak outlook on the human lot, and their love of
fate sprung from a philosophy of powerlessness within one's own life,
not from any grand cosmogony.
<!-- This springs from a bleak outlook on the human lot rather than any
cosmogonic musings. -->

This Stoic "will to reality" seems radically different from Nietzche's
infamous (and infamously misunderstood) "will to power".
When co-opted by the Nazis, it was solely about power over others, but in
*Thus Spake Zarathustra*, it is very obviously about power over the
self, or "self-overcoming" as he would write elsewhere, an
"unexhausted procreative will of life".
This "will to life" seems more apt to me than the "will to power", and
also distinct from the Schopenhauerian "will to live", or mere
self-preservation.
Returning to the Stoics, one can't help but feel that, in Nietzschean terms, there is
something "anti-life" about their now proverbial acceptance of
whatever came their way.

[*Note*: Nietzsche does discuss power over others, but
unlike the creative "self-overcoming" and "will to life", it is often in naturalistic terms,
so I'm not sure to what extent he makes a virtue  of it.
Whatever the case, here I just want to focus on how
this relates to fatalism.]

#### Fatalism and free will

The question becomes, how is necessity 

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
What does your conscience say?—'You shall become the person you are'.
</span>

#### Brainjamor

Brainjam does not posit that time is cyclic.
We get one life, which we are doomed to live, moment by moment, in perpetuity.
<!-- Although the details differ from eternal recurrence, the implications
are the same: you will live forever, but this particular life, so make
it a good one. -->
<!-- Although *amor fati* is naturally connected to this idea, it does not
obviously follow. In Nietzsche's case, a love of life in all its
supra-moral necessity came first, and the pretty thought
experiment---eternal recurrence---was the brilliant afterthought.
I'd like to go in the other direction, starting with brainjam and
seeing what loves, if any, it licenses, the "brainjamor" if you'll
excuse the highbrow doggerel.
If we are boringly Humean-->
This is like eternal recurrence, but "parallelised": each
conscious moment is replayed in parallel, rather than in the serial repetitions of cyclic time.
<!-- The emphasis on moments in some sense "parallelises" eternal
recurrence. -->
