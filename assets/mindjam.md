**January 13, 2021.** *In a
  [previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
  I advanced a four-dimensionalist version of eternal recurrence. I
  consider some of the moral consequences.*

#### Introduction

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I argued that it was possible to reconcile four-dimensionalism (a
belief that all times exist) with our peculiar experience of time.
Put simply, each moment is *always* being experienced, a sort
of "brainjam" by which our life is pickled into the
spacetime continuum.
The sense that time passes, the impression of sequence, is (and must
be) a cognitive artefact rather than some incorrigible metaphysical fact.
For arguments in favour of this view, and other elaborations, I refer
to that post.
Here, I want to focus on some of the consequences of brainjam.

#### Eternal recurrence and amor fati

First, we can compare brainjam to the doctrine of eternal recurrence,
the idea that time is cyclic and we are doomed to repeat ourselves.
Evidently, this is an archetypal thought, popping up everywhere in
classical antiquity, from Egypt to India, Greece to Mesoamerica.
Cycles have a certain economy of pattern, and even today,
[cyclic views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycles_of_Time)
of the universe remain popular.
Brainjam does not posit that time is cyclic.
We get one life, which we are doomed to live, moment by moment, in perpetuity.
<!-- Although the details differ from eternal recurrence, the implications
are the same: you will live forever, but this particular life, so make
it a good one. -->
<!-- Although *amor fati* is naturally connected to this idea, it does not
obviously follow. In Nietzsche's case, a love of life in all its
supra-moral necessity came first, and the pretty thought
experiment---eternal recurrence---was the brilliant afterthought.
I'd like to go in the other direction, starting with brainjam and
seeing what loves, if any, it licenses, the "brainjamor" if you'll
excuse the highbrow doggerel.
If we are boringly Humean-->
Brainjam is like eternal recurrence, but "parallelised": each
conscious moment is replayed in parallel, rather than in the serial repetitions of cyclic time.
<!-- The emphasis on moments in some sense "parallelises" eternal
recurrence. -->

For all its metaphysical prettiness, the ethical dimensions of
recurrence are no less important.
The Stoics taught a "love of fate", or *amor fati*. For instance, in
his *Meditations*, Marcus Aurelius writes

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with
whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.
</span>

Almost 2000 years later, Friedrich Nietzsche would turn eternal
recurrence and *amor fati* into an ethic, a
love of reality beyond the stale, life-denying categories of European thought.
<!-- to counterbalance his infamously negative attitudes towards European
morality. -->
*Ecce Homo* states this ethic clearly:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
My formula for greatness in a human being is *amor fati*: that one wants
nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all
eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all
idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love it.
</span>

For Nietzsche, the love of life in all its
supra-moral necessity came first, and eternal recurrence the brilliant
afterthought.
<!--, or rather, of the love of necessity.-->
It was less a metaphysical insight than a moral
thought experiment for guiding one towards a love of fate.
<!-- guiding the individual towards *amor fati*. -->
<!-- Eternal recurrence rather a thought experiment by which to guide the individual towards
*amor fati*.
He equates this with a love of life and a rejection of the milquetoast
religious sensibilities he so detested. 
Whatever the similarities, there are subtle shifts in emphasis that
will lead us away, I think, from the indiscriminate acceptance of
Nietzsche's *amor fati*. -->
But I find Nietzsche's formulas, and the parallel to the Stoics,
ambiguous.

Both made a virtue of necessity.
For the Stoics, however, the emphasis is on the *fati*, the
powerlessness of human beings to intervene in the operation of the
universe.
The *amor* is merely the adaptive reaction.
As Epitectus writes (*Discourses*),

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Being educated is precisely learning to will each thing just as it happens.
</span>
<!-- The Stoics had a bleak outlook on the human lot, and their love of
fate sprung from a philosophy of powerlessness within one's own life,
not from any grand cosmogony.
<!-- This springs from a bleak outlook on the human lot rather than any
cosmogonic musings. -->

It is something we must literally learn to live with.

#### Fatalism and free will
