**January 12, 2021.** *In a
  [previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
  I advanced a four-dimensionalist version of eternal recurrence. I
  consider some of the moral consequences.*

#### Introduction

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I argued that it was possible to reconcile four-dimensionalism (a
belief that all times exist) with our peculiar experience of time.
Put simply, each moment is *always* being experienced, a sort
of "brainjam" by which our life is pickled into the
spacetime continuum.
The sense that time passes, the impression of sequence, is (and must
be) a cognitive artefact rather than some incorrigible metaphysical fact.
For arguments in favour of this view, and other elaborations, I refer
to that post.
Here, I want to focus on some of the consequences of brainjam.

#### Eternal recurrence and amor fati

First, we can compare brainjam to the doctrine of eternal recurrence,
the idea that time is cyclic and we are doomed to repeat ourselves.
Evidently, this is an archetypal thought, popping up everywhere in
classical antiquity, from Egypt to India, Greece to Mesoamerica.
Cycles have a certain economy of pattern, and even today,
[cyclic views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycles_of_Time)
of the universe remain popular.
But for all its metaphysical prettiness, the ethical dimensions of
recurrence are no less important.
The Stoics taught a "love of fate", or *amor fati*. For instance, in
his *Meditations* (VI 39), Marcus Aurelius writes

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with
whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.
</span>

Almost 2000 years later, Friedrich Nietzsche would turn eternal
recurrence and *amor fati* into an ethic, a love of reality to replace
the European hostility to life.
<!-- to counterbalance his infamously negative attitudes towards European
morality. -->
*Ecce Homo* states this ethic clearly:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
My formula for greatness in a human being is *amor fati*: that one wants
nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all
eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all
idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love it.
</span>

Nietzsche made a virtue of necessity. <!--, or rather, of the love of necessity.-->
Eternal recurrence was less a metaphysical insight than a moral
principle for guiding the individual towards *amor fati*.
<!-- Eternal recurrence rather a thought experiment by which to guide the individual towards
*amor fati*.
He equates this with a love of life and a rejection of the milquetoast
religious sensibilities he so detested. -->
