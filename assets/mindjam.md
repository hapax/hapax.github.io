**January 13, 2021.** *In a
  [previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
  I advanced a four-dimensionalist version of eternal recurrence. I
  consider some of the moral consequences.*

#### Introduction

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I argued that it was possible to reconcile four-dimensionalism (a
belief that all times exist) with our peculiar experience of time.
Put simply, each moment is *always* being experienced, a sort
of "brainjam" by which our life is pickled into the
spacetime continuum.
The sense that time passes, the impression of sequence, is (and must
be) a cognitive artefact rather than some incorrigible metaphysical fact.
For arguments in favour of this view, and other elaborations, I refer
to that post.
Here, I want to discuss some of the broader philosophical aspects of brainjam.

#### Eternal recurrence and amor fati

We can compare brainjam to the doctrine of eternal recurrence,
the idea that time is cyclic and we are doomed to repeat ourselves.
Evidently, this is an archetypal thought, popping up everywhere in
classical antiquity from Egypt to India, Greece to Mesoamerica.
Cycles have a certain economy of pattern, and even today,
[cyclic views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycles_of_Time)
of the universe remain popular.
For all its metaphysical prettiness, the ethical dimensions of
recurrence are no less important.
The Stoics taught a "love of fate", or *amor fati*. Take the aphorism
of Marcus Aurelius (*Meditations*),

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with
whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.
</span>

Almost 2000 years later, Friedrich Nietzsche would combine eternal
recurrence and *amor fati* into a similar ethic, a
love of reality beyond the stale, life-denying categories of European thought.
<!-- to counterbalance his infamously negative attitudes towards European
morality. -->
In *Ecce Homo*, he states

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
My formula for greatness in a human being is *amor fati*: that one wants
nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all
eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all
idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love it.
</span>

For Nietzsche, the love of life in all its
supra-moral necessity came first, and eternal recurrence was the brilliant
afterthought,
<!--, or rather, of the love of necessity.-->
less a metaphysical insight than a moral
heuristic for guiding one towards a love of fate.
<!-- guiding the individual towards *amor fati*. -->
<!-- Eternal recurrence rather a thought experiment by which to guide the individual towards
*amor fati*.
He equates this with a love of life and a rejection of the milquetoast
religious sensibilities he so detested. 
Whatever the similarities, there are subtle shifts in emphasis that
will lead us away, I think, from the indiscriminate acceptance of
Nietzsche's *amor fati*. -->
But I find Nietzsche's formulas, and the parallel to the Stoics,
ambiguous and problematic.
Both made a virtue of necessity.
For the Stoics, however, the emphasis is on the *fati*, the
powerlessness of human beings to intervene in the operation of the
universe.
The *amor* is merely the adaptive reaction.
As Epitectus writes (*Discourses*),

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Being educated is precisely learning to will each thing just as it happens.
</span>
<!-- The Stoics had a bleak outlook on the human lot, and their love of
fate sprung from a philosophy of powerlessness within one's own life,
not from any grand cosmogony.
<!-- This springs from a bleak outlook on the human lot rather than any
cosmogonic musings. -->

This Stoic "will of reality" seems radically different from Nietzche's
infamous (and perhaps infamously misunderstood) "will to power".
When co-opted by the Nazis, it was solely about power over others [<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>], but in
*Thus Spake Zarathustra*, it is very obviously about power over the
self, or "self-overcoming" as he would write elsewhere, an
"unexhausted procreative will of life".

<!-- This "will of life" seems to more aptly capture the difference from
the Stoics than the "will to power".
<!-- , and also distinct from the Schopenhauerian "will to live", or mere
self-preservation. -->
The "will of life" seems almost like the opposite of Epitectus' "will of
reality", and the Stoic acceptance of whatever comes your way a kind
of will to powerlessness.
<!-- In Nietzschean terms, there is something "anti-life" about the (now
proverbial) Stoic acceptance of whatever comes your way. -->
But Nietzsche's enthusiasm for what is necessary itself seems to verge
on the indiscriminate, differing from the Stoics more on
aesthetic than moral grounds.
Take this famous passage from *The Gay Science*:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in
things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. *Amor
fati*: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war
against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to
accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And
all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.
</span>

Should we really say yes to everything? To suffering, to cruelty, to
forces which are explicitly against life? It's hard not to see
Nietzche the invalid peeking through here, scribbling madly in his sister's
garret and saying yes to his own suffering because like the Stoics, he
has no choice in the matter and would prefer to love rather than hate
it.
But not every necessity is virtuous, and a healthy creature can tell
the difference between what is good and what is bad for it.
This is part of the very "will of life" that Nietzsche exhorts, but
could not himself exercise.
There is a sickness in loving what is bad.

I think the doctrine of necessity and Yes-saying has things to
recommend it.
Suffering, privation, and doubt are not always or necessarily bad, a
point I will return to below.
But appraising them in the scheme of a healthy life, on which one
trains the "unexhausted procreative will", is more complex and
potentially individual than an undifferentiated Yes.

#### Fatalism and free will

A fatalist might object that, life or anti-life, you can't argue with
reality.
Both the Stoics and Nietzsche seem to subscribe to some form of
fatalism, that the course of events is fixed and inevitable.
As is often the case, the relationship between
Nietzsche's ideas on the matter are fuzzy and contentious.
But as this line from the *The Gay Science* shows, Nietzsche somehow
believed both in fate and the individual as constituted by
self-creative acts:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
What does your conscience say? — 'You shall become the person you are'.
</span>

In a sense, who we are *is* our fate.
This does not prevent our choices from being meaningful, and perhaps
more sharply, 

#### Brainjamor

Brainjam does not posit that time is cyclic.
We get one life, which we are doomed to live, moment by moment, in perpetuity.
<!-- Although the details differ from eternal recurrence, the implications
are the same: you will live forever, but this particular life, so make
it a good one. -->
<!-- Although *amor fati* is naturally connected to this idea, it does not
obviously follow. In Nietzsche's case, a love of life in all its
supra-moral necessity came first, and the pretty thought
experiment---eternal recurrence---was the brilliant afterthought.
I'd like to go in the other direction, starting with brainjam and
seeing what loves, if any, it licenses, the "brainjamor" if you'll
excuse the highbrow doggerel.
If we are boringly Humean-->
This is like eternal recurrence, but "parallelised": each
conscious moment is replayed in parallel, rather than in the serial repetitions of cyclic time.
<!-- The emphasis on moments in some sense "parallelises" eternal
recurrence. -->

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" name="fn.1" class="footnum"
href="#fnr.1">Footnote 1</a></sup> <p class="footpara">
Nietzsche does discuss power over others, but
unlike the creative "self-overcoming" or "will of life", it is more often in
naturalistic terms, and I'm not sure to what extent he makes a virtue  of it.
Whatever the case, here I just want to focus on how it relates to
<i>amor fati</i>.
