**August 30, 2018.** *Sufficiently complex quantum mechanical systems
  look random, in the sense that we can model their evolution as an
  operator chosen uniformly at random. Here, I'll explain what
  "uniformly at random" means, and discuss a simple graphical method
  for calculating average properties of these random systems. I'll finish with a
  proof of Page's theorem, a beautiful result connecting random
  evolution to entanglement, and discuss its application to black holes.*
