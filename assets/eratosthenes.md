**August 6, 2020.** *Eratosthenes measured the size of the earth
  using three data points: two shadows and the distance between
  them. During the equinox in March, I performed a (much less elegant)
  version of the same experiment, and discuss my results.*

Eratosthenes (276--195 BC) was head librarian at the Library of
  Alexandria, and one of the great thinkers of the ancient world.
In a blow to civilization, the library was destroyed by invading Roman
  emperors, and most of Eratosthenes' work along with it.  Thankfully, his elegant method
  for calculating the size of the earth, using only the shadow of a
  stick (or really two sticks), survives.

  On the summer solstice, locals in the Egyptian city of
  Syene noticed that, at noon, the sun hit the bottom of a deep well.
  Eratosthenes inferred that the sun must be directly overhead.
He also knew from Egyptian surveyors that Syene was roughly $5000$
  stadia ($\approx 850 \,\mathrm{km}$) away from Alexandria.
  Eratosthenes performed a single experiment.  At noon on the summer
  solstice, he measured the shadow of a vertical rod in Alexandria.
  He found it was roughly $1/8$ of the length of the rod.
