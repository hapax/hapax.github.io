**March 29, 2021.** *Black holes leak energy into the environment and
  ultimately evaporate. In this post, I'll explore two applications of
  evaporation: estimating the life expectancy of the universe, and
  showing that the LHC cannot produce dangerous black holes.*

#### 1. Introduction<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

In 1974, Stephen Hawking discovered that black holes glow.
This means that, over time, a black hole loses energy and eventually
disappears altogether.
We're going to use this to do some fun stuff, first guessing the
time until entropic heat death, and secondly, giving a heuristic
argument that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) does not produce
dangerous microscopic black holes.
We won't derive anything in detail, but rather, slap estimates together
to get an order-of-magnitude vibe for what's going on.
Our key formula will be that, for a black hole of mass $M$, the
evaporation timescale is roughly

$$
t_\text{evap} \sim \frac{G^2M^3}{\hbar c^4} \sim 10^{67} \text{ years}
\left(\frac{M}{M_\odot}\right)^3,
$$

where $M_\odot = 2\times 10^{30} \text{ kg}$ is the mass of the sun,
and $G$ is Newton's constant, $c$ the speed of light, and $\hbar$ is
Planck's constant. I'll explain these constants if and when we need
them.
Now for our applications!

Careful observation of the night sky reveals that everything is flying
apart at an accelerating rate. Eventually, every galaxy will be
trapped in its
