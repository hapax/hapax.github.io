**March 29, 2021.** *Black holes leak energy into the environment and
  ultimately evaporate. In this post, I'll explore two applications of
  evaporation: estimating the life expectancy of the universe, and
  showing that the LHC cannot produce dangerous black holes.*

Stephen Hawking discovered that black holes glow.
This means that, over time, they will lose energy and eventually
disappear altogether.
