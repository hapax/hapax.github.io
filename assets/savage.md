**September 4, 2013.** *Review of* The Savage Detectives (1998), *Roberto
  Bolaño's ironic love letter to his youth.*

Roberto Bolaño occupies an interesting position in the Latin American
republic of letters. On the one hand, we have the enfant terrible, the
avant-garde poet and Trotskyite who crashed readings and wrote
manifestos. On the other, we have the mature, cosmopolitan successor
to Márquez and Borges. In *The Savage Detectives*, the latter reflects
with humour and nostalgia on the former.

The book is divided into three parts. "Mexicans Lost in Mexico" (I)
and "The Sonora Desert" (III) recount the adventures of Juan García
Madero, a young poet trying to break into the 'visceral realist'
circle and befriend prime movers Arturo Belano (Bolaño's alter ego)
and Ulises Lima. Visceral realism is clearly a roman à clef for the
infrarealist movement Bolaño founded as a young man. Madero's story
begins as a gentle parody of visceral realism; by the last section, it
has become a katabatic road trip into the desert worthy of McCarthy or
Melville. Bolaño's focus on the desert, and pursuit and transformation
within it, foreshadows his magnum opus *2666*.

Like the wayfarer on the shutters of Bosch's [Haywain Triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haywain_Triptych),
Madero's neat, linear narrative conceals an explosion at the centre of
the novel. Part II, "The Savage Detectives", is a mosaic of
first-person vignettes spanning two decades and four continents. These
give shifting, ambiguous insights into the fate of visceral realism
and its members, especially Lima and Belano. The epistolary format
places a barrier between the reader and Lima/Belano which is at once
mythical and terribly sad. At times, the section feels like an elegy;
perhaps to a lost generation, or a generation who were, and will
remain, unknowable.

But it also feels like a celebration of their vitality. Indeed, in his
papers, Bolaño indicated that Arturo Belano was the narrator of *2666*
and suggested that the novel finish with the postscript

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
<i>And that’s it, friends. I’ve done it all, I’ve lived it all. If I had the strength, I’d cry. I bid you all goodbye, Arturo Belano.</i>
</span>

The Savage Detectives is a melancholy 500-page metafictional footnote
to Belano's farewall.
