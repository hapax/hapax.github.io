**November 3, 2020.** *If a dice is symmetric, we can ignore the
  mechanics of rolling in analysing fairness. But if the dice is
  asymmetric, the mechanics become important, and fairness depends on
  how fast you roll! We'll analyse a relatively simple 2d example, and
  show how to "dynamically load" fair dice.*

#### Static fairness

Suppose we are rolling a 2d dice.
