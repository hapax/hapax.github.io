**November 3, 2020.** *Usually, the fairness of diceis analysed using
  symmetry. Here, I think in a bit more detail about the mechanics of
  dice rolling in a simple 2d example, and find that there are
  different notions of fairness, and hence difference notions of
  loading, depending on how fast you roll the dice. The two notions
  only agree for a regular dice.*

#### Static fairness
