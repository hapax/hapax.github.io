**January 19, 2021.** *Why are dice and coins good sources of
  randomness? The processes involved any dice throw are
  deterministic. To understand the forces at play---chaos and
  deterministic jitter---we'll build highly simplified but effective
  dice from scratch.*

#### Introduction

Each time I roll a dice, my muscles try to do the same thing. But even
if I hold the dice the same way, and throw in what feels like the same
way, I seem to get any side of the dice with equal probability.
If you ask why a mathematician why any side appears with the same
odds, they might say *symmetry*. Apart from the pips indicating the
value [<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>], the sides are indistinguishable and therefore must have equal
probability of landing right side up.
This is true and sounds like a nice explanation.
But it's actually irrelevant!

To see why, suppose I take a very large dice, so heavy that I can only
drop it.
In this case, it's unlikely to roll, and will most likely just land on
the side that I drop it.
Now, if I pick which side I want to drop it on randomly, then I will
get a random outcome, but I can certainly distinguish the different
sides due to the pips!
The symmetry is important, but it ignores the role of the roll.

#### Chaos

The pips do create a bias unless they are drilled, then filled with
black paint of the same density as the dice material. This is standard
procedure for "precision" dice used at casinos or by professional gamblers.
