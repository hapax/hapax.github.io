**January 19, 2021.** *Why are dice and coins good sources of
  randomness? The processes involved any dice throw are
  deterministic. To understand the forces at play---chaos and
  deterministic jitter---we'll build highly simplified but effective
  dice from scratch.*

#### Introduction

Each time I roll a dice, my muscles try to do the same thing. But even
if I hold the dice the same way, and throw in what feels like the same
way, I seem to get any side of the dice with equal probability.
If you ask why a mathematician why any side appears with the same
odds, they might say *symmetry*. Apart from the pips indicating the
value, the sides are indistinguishable and therefore must have equal
probability of landing right side up.
