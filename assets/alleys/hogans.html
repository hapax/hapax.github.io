<h1 class="title"><i>Hogan’s Alley, c. 1920</i></h1>

<p>Hogan’s Alley had a large black presence from the 1920’s,
  especially after a black church by the name of ‘Fountain Chapel’
  opened on the corner of Jackson Avenue and Hogan’s Alley in 1922.</p>

<p>Like Blood Alley, the actual provenance of the name “Hogan” is
  unknown, but was likely a reference to an 1890’s newspaper comic
  strip Hogan’s Alley featuring the Yellow Kid<label for="sn-1"

  Yellow Kid — satirical comic character, popular in the late 20th century; a bald, snaggle-toothed boy with an oversized yellow nightshirt and goofy grin.
</span>
in New York’s Irish
  slums. At that time, invoking the name of the alley in reference to
  campers (such as those who camped on English Bay in the summers) was
  an insult, meaning that they were  “slumming it”.</p>

<p>Hogan’s Alley’s borders, at least in reference if not in actuality,
  expanded to include other areas. At first, it was extended to
  another lane which ran east between Union Street and Park Lane. This
  lane was notorious in the 30’s and 40’s for housing bootleggers,
  after hours clubs, and gambling joints. More recently, ‘Hogan’s
  Alley’ has come to refer to the historic black community both within
  and surrounding both lanes, including a particularly famous southern
  fried chicken joint that once stood  on the corner of Union Street
  and Park Lane. Formerly a bootlegging joint <label for="sn-1"

Vie’s was open every day from 5pm to 5am, and only served fried chicken and steak. Each steak was cooked in a giant cast iron pan on an oil fired stove that heated the entire restaurant, and Vie was famous for never burning a steak. 
Vie’s Chicken and Steak House was originally Louis Mattlo’s
  bootlegging joint. In 1937, the VPD decided to padlock the building to punish/discourage bootlegging, but accidentally padlocked the family tabby cat inside the building. Police officers were forced to go back into the padlocked building to rescue the cat.
</span>, Vie’s Chicken and
  Steak House sat on the corner of Union Street and Park Lane, and
  for more than 30 years played host to some of the most incredible
  black performers of their times, including Nat King Cole, Louis
  Armstrong, Sammy Davis Jr, Ella Fitzgerald, and later Jimi
  Hendrix.<label for="sn-1"

Jimi Hendrix’s grandmother Nora Hendrix was actually a founder of the Fountain Chapel, and worked as a cook at Vue’s Chicken and Steakhouse.
</span></p>

<p>Hogan’s Alley was eventually demolished, along with other black
  neighbourhoods, as part of preparations to build a network of
  freeways in the 1960’s. Due to public backlash the freeways were
  never actually built, but the Georgia and Dunsmuir viaducts still
  lie across what was once Hogan’s Alley. </p>
