**January 6, 2020.** *Physics is often presented as the most arcane,
  mathematically impenetrable of natural sciences. Here, we illustrate
  how some simple physics hacks, involving on pre-calculus
  mathematics, can still be awesomely powerful.*

## 1. Introduction <a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

I've been heavily involved in running a
[high school physics circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/)
for over a year now.
I've learned a lot about logistics, managing people, and leadership.
But surprisingly, the biggest lesson has been about *physics itself*.
In a physics circle, the mandate is to write problems that high school
students will find challenging but fair, given their limited
background knowledge.
In particular, we do not use calculus in our problems.

## Extra

*Physics is often presented as the most arcane
  and mathematically challenging of natural sciences. But simple physical
  ideas, combined with pre-calculus mathematics, can be
  mind-bogglingly powerful. I give several examples.*

Our best theories of nature seem to involve hard mathematics.
We have electromagnetism, formulated in the language of vector
\[
\begin{align*}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} & = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\rho \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} & = 0 \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} & = -\mu\dot{\mathbf{B}} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} & = \mu\mathbf{J} + \epsilon\dot{\mathbf{E}}
\end{align*}
\]
to Schr√∂dinger
\[
i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi\rangle = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + \hat{V}\right)|\psi\rangle
\]
to Einstein
\[
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}\Lambda R g_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu\nu},
\]
physics seems at its most powerful and exotic when expressed in
mathematical language.
The more opaque, the more powerful and exotic it seems.

**January 6, 2020.** *Physics is often presented as arcane and
  mathematically challenging. In this post, I try to counter this
  notion by showing that simple physical ideas, combined with
  pre-calculus mathematics, can be mind-bogglingly powerful.*

Physics is embedded in mathematics.
Our best theories of nature seem to require it, and are often stated in the
pithy but impenetrable form of *equations*.
For instance, we can summarise gravity with *Einstein's field equations*:
\[
R_{\mu\nu} -\frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}.
\]
This is a startingly beautiful result, but requires years of training
to appreciate mathematically.
