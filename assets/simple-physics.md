## 1. Introduction <a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

For the last year or so, I've been heavily involved in running a
[high school physics circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/).
I've learned a lot about logistics, leadership, and leaning
towers of pizza, but surprisingly, the biggest lesson has been about *physics itself*.
In a physics circle, the mandate is to write problems that high school
students find challenging but fair given their limited background
knowledge.
In particular, problems should avoid calculus, which is not part of
Canada's high school curriculum.
Judging from competition problems, this should restrict us to
tediously intricate mechanics problems, with a smattering of circuits,
optics, and other elementary topics.

I decided to view this as a challenge: do more with less.
I am not above writing tediously intricate mechanics problems.
But it was much more instructive to master the basic hacks and use
them to teach myself some new things.
I'm not sure about the students, but it certainly made me a better physicist!
The goal of this post is to share a few of these hacks and convince
you of their awesome power.

To keep things interesting, I avoid overlap with my
[physics circle problems](https://hapax.github.io/assets/circle-probs.pdf),
though feel free to check these out if you want more examples than you
can dangle a plumb bob at.
I also recommend Sanjoy Mahajan's book
[*Street-Fighting Mathematics*](http://streetfightingmath.com/) (which
I only discovered recently!), covering similar ground in greater depth.
The hacks are in no particular order except for the "fundamental hacks" of
dimensional analysis and Fermi estimation.
Everything else can be read independently and in any order.
For each hack, I quickly outline the physics, do some examples,
and finish with usage notes.

## 2. Dimensional analysis <a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

Physics is ultimately about experimental measurements.
We take some system, e.g., an old pumpkin, and poke or prod it with a
measuring device, thereby obtaining a number.
The *dimension* of the measurement is not the number, but the
*physical property* probed by that device.
If we compare the width of the pumpkin to a ruler, for instance, the
dimension is the *length*.

Length ($L$) is one of the basic dimensions we can use to build other
dimensions.
The two other basic dimensions are *time* ($T$) and *mass* ($M$).
In general, we apply brackets $[\cdot]$ to a measurement to extract
the dimension, for instance

$$
[1 \text{ cm}] = L, \quad [4 \text{ hours}] = T, \quad [400 \text{ lb}] = M.
$$

We throw away the number out front and focus on the unit, asking: what
aspect of the system does it measure? Centimetres measure length,
hours measure time, and pounds measure mass.
More complicated dimensions follow from the basic ones according to
simple algebraic rules.
These are easier to show than tell.
Area, for example, has dimensions $L^2$:

$$
[1 \text{ cm}^2] = [1 \text{ cm} \times 1 \text{ cm}] = [1 \text{ cm}]
\times [1 \text{ cm}] = L^2.
$$

Rather than use the units, we can use general formulas, e.g. for the area of a rectangle:

$$
[\text{area}] = [\text{width}\times \text{height}] = [\text{width}]
\times [\text{height}] = L^2.
$$

Similarly, we can divide out dimensions:

$$
[\text{velocity}] = \left[\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}\right] =
\frac{[\text{distance}]}{[\text{time}]} = \frac{L}{T}.
$$

Physical laws tell us how measurements depend
on each other.
For example, Newton's second law $F = ma$ tells us how measurements of
force, mass and acceleration are related.
If the two sides of $F = ma$ are equal, the dimensions must agree.
Remarkably, we can sometimes *reverse* this process, and determine the
physical laws relating some quantities from their dimensions!
Once again, this is easier to show with examples than abstract descriptions.

#### 2.1. Pendulous pumpkins <a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a>

Suppose we attach the old pumpkin to a length of string and give it a
kick.
Gravity will pull on the pumpkin, causing it to oscillate back and
forth with some period of oscillation $t$.
If we know how the period of oscillation depends on other properties
of the system, we can utilise this knowledge to make a pumpkin clock!
Let's start by listing the possibly relevant properties of the system:
- the mass of the pumpkin $m$, with dimension $[m] = M$;
- the length of the string $\ell$, dimension $[\ell] = L$;
- gravitational acceleration $g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$, dimension $[g] =
  LT^{-2}$ (from the units);
- the initial displacement of the pumpkin $x$, dimension $[x] = L$.

Not all of these quantities will turn out to be relevant.
For instance, the size of the initial kick $x$ can be discarded.
Why?
Go grab a string, a pumpkin, and a stopwatch, and you'll find that
(at least for small kicks) the period is independent of the size of
the kick.
That leaves the pumpkin mass $m$, string length $\ell$, and gravity $g$.
You can also eliminate the pumpkin mass empirically, but as we'll see,
we can leave it in and let dimensional analysis *tell us* it's irrelevant.

I'm going to do something a bit sneaky, though it will seem natural if
you've dealt with oscillations before.
Instead of period $t$, we will deal with the *angular frequency*

$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{t}.
$$

If we imagine the oscillations as being ticked off on a clock of unit
radius, with one cycle per period, then this is just the velocity of
the tip of the hand.
Dimensional analysis is nothing fancier than guessing that $\omega$ is related to $m$,
$\ell$ and $g$ by a physical law of the form

$$
\omega = m^a \ell^b g^c,
$$

for some powers $a, b, c$.
We can determine the powers from the dimensions of each side:

$$
\begin{align*}
T^{-1} = [\omega] = [m^a \ell^c g^c] = \frac{M^aL^{b+c}}{T^{2c}}.
\end{align*}
$$

Requiring the leftmost and rightmost expression to be equal, we can immediately read off the powers:
$a = 0$, $2c = 1$, $b = -c$, and hence $\omega \sim (g/c)^{1/2}$, where $\sim$ means "up to numerical factors".
As promised, dimensional analysis also kindly informs us that the mass
is irrelevant.
In fact, my earlier piece of sneakiness (replacing period with angular
frequency) means this is *exactly* correct (for small kicks):

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{\ell}}.
$$

Let me emphase how powerful this is.
We didn't need to analyse any forces, solve a differential
equation, or even deal with numbers.
Dimensional analysis let us skip straight to the answer!

Suppose we want to make a pumpkin clock with the conventional
grandfather-clock period of $t = 2 \text{
s}$, so that each half swing takes
one second.
Then we should suspend the old pumpkin from a string of length

$$
\ell = \frac{g}{\omega^2} = \frac{g t^2}{(2\pi)^2} = \frac{9.8 \text{
m}}{\pi^2} \approx 1
\text{ m}.
$$

Incidentally, this explains why grandfather clocks are so large!
They need to house a large (usually non-cucurbitar) pendulum of
length around one metre.

In order to make the clock, we need a ruler to measure out the length
of string.
But for maximal whimsy, we can turn a stopwatch, pumpkin and spool of
string *into* a ruler!
Use the string as a ruler, snip off the corresponding length, attach
the pumpkin and start it gently wobbling.
The period tells us the length!

#### 2.3. Usage notes<a id="sec-2-4" name="sec-2-4"></a>

Since we throw away numbers, dimensional analysis will usually only be
good up to an overall numerical factor.

Our best theories of nature seem to involve hard mathematics.
We have electromagnetism, formulated in the language of vector
\[
\begin{align*}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} & = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\rho \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} & = 0 \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} & = -\mu\dot{\mathbf{B}} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} & = \mu\mathbf{J} + \epsilon\dot{\mathbf{E}}
\end{align*}
\]
to Schr√∂dinger
\[
i\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi\rangle = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + \hat{V}\right)|\psi\rangle
\]
to Einstein
\[
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}\Lambda R g_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu\nu},
\]
physics seems at its most powerful and exotic when expressed in
mathematical language.
The more opaque, the more powerful and exotic it seems.

**January 6, 2020.** *Physics is often presented as arcane and
  mathematically challenging. In this post, I try to counter this
  notion by showing that simple physical ideas, combined with
  pre-calculus mathematics, can be mind-bogglingly powerful.*

Physics is embedded in mathematics.
Our best theories of nature seem to require it, and are often stated in the
pithy but impenetrable form of *equations*.
For instance, we can summarise gravity with *Einstein's field equations*:
\[
R_{\mu\nu} -\frac{1}{2}R g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}.
\]
This is a startingly beautiful result, but requires years of training
to appreciate mathematically.

Suppose you want to build a pendulum-driven grandfather clock, with
the mass suspended on a light rod $\ell = 1.5$ metres long.
Approximately how heavy should the pendulum itself be if you want it
to swing back and forth with a period of $t = 1$ second?
We can answer this with dimensional analysis.
We first identify a *target* quantity: the thing we are trying to
control, predict or measure.
In this case, it is the *mass* of the pendulum $m$, which has the
dimension $M$:

$$
[m] = M.
$$

We then list the *relevant parameters* which physically determine our
target quantity.
In this case, they are the period of the pendulum $t$, the length of the
rod $\ell$, and the strength of gravity $g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$, without
which the pendulum will not oscillate!
From the units, this has dimension

$$
[g] = [9.8 \text{ m/s}^2] = \frac{[\text{m}]}{[\text{s}^2]} = \frac{L}{T^2}.
$$

In summary, the relevant parameters and dimensions are:
- period, $[t] = T$;
- length, $[\ell] = L$;
- gravitational acceleration, $[g] = L/T^2$.
We now guess that the target quantity is some *product of powers* of
the relevant parameters,

$$
m = t^a \ell^b g^c,
$$

and by analysing the dimensions on both sides, figure out
what those powers are.
On the LHS, we have dimension $m$.
On the RHS, we have dimensions

$$
\begin{align*}
[t^a \ell^b g^c] & = T^a L^b \cdot \frac{L^c}{T^{2c}}  = \frac{T}{}
\end{align*}
$$

#### 2.2. Example: spring-mass system <a id="sec-2-2" name="sec-2-2"></a>

Suppose you want to build a spring-driven clock, with time marked off
by the oscillations of a mass stuck to the spring.
When the spring is compressed or extended, you measure the restoring
force $F$ and notice that it is proportional to the displacement $x$
from the spring's equilbrium position
([Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law)):

$$
F = kx.
$$

This constant $k$ is called the *stiffness*, and it has dimensions

$$
[k] = \frac{[F]}{[x]} = \frac{[ma]}{[x]} = \frac{ML}{T^2L} = \frac{M}{T^2}.
$$

To make our clock, we want the mass to oscillate with a period of $t_\text{period} =
1$ second.
If you are familiar with harmonic motion, you know that a nicer
quantity than period is *angular frequency*:

$$
\omega =
\frac{2\pi}{t_\text{period}},
$$

with dimensions $1/T$.
To help design the clock, we want to know how the angular frequency $\omega$
depends on the stiffness $k$ of the spring and mass $m$.

The general procedure for dimensional analysis is as follows.
We first identify a *target* quantity: the thing we are trying to
control, predict or measure.
In this case, it is the angular frequency.
We then list the *relevant parameters* which our target quantity should
depend on.
In this case, these are the stiffness $k$ and mass $m$, with dimensions
- stiffness, $[k] = M/T^2$;
- mass $[m] = M$.

We now guess that the target quantity is a *product of powers* of
the relevant parameters, taking the form:

$$
\omega = k^a m^b.
$$

(I'll comment on how this assumption can break down in the usage notes.)
We can find the powers $a$ and $b$ from the requirement that the
dimensions on both sides are equal:

$$
\begin{align*}
[k^a m^b] &= \frac{M^a}{T^{2a}}\cdot M^b = \frac{M^{a+b}}{T^{2a}} \\
[\omega] &= \frac{1}{T}.
\end{align*}
$$

Since there are no factors of mass for the RHS, we have $b = -a$, and
hence $T^{2a} = T$, or $a = 1/2$.
Thus, dimensional analysis gives

$$
\omega \sim \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},
$$

where $\sim$ indicates that some numbers may have gone astray.
In fact, our sneaky choice of angular frequency $\omega$ instead of
period $t_\text{period}$ means this is *exactly* correct, numbers and
all.
(If we stuck with period we would be off by a factor of $2\pi$, which
is not ideal if we want to design a precision timepiece.)
We didn't need to analyse any forces, solve a differential
equation, or even deal with numbers.
Dimensional analysis let us skip straight to the answer!

So, if your high school physics lab has springs of stiffness $k = 10^2 \text{
N/m}$ ($100$ Newtons for every meter displaced), then to obtain an
oscillation period of $ t_\text{period} =1$ second, you should attach
a mass

$$
m = \frac{k t_\text{period}^2}{4\pi^2} = \frac{10^2 \text{
kg}}{4\pi^2} \approx 2.5 \text{ kg}.
$$

1. Using dimensional analysis, show that the angular frequency does
   not depend on the initial displacement $x$ of the mass.

#### 2.3. Example: the wobbling pupm <a id="sec-2-3" name="sec-2-3"></a>

The spring-mass example is neat, but not particularly exciting.
We can make it more interesting by adding some quantum mechanics into
the mix.
The *fundamental constant* appearing in quantum mechanics is *Planck's
constant*, with SI value

$$
\hbar = 1.05 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}.
$$

(Technically, this is the "reduced" Planck constant favoured by
theoretical physicists. The original constant is $h = 2\pi \hbar$.)
