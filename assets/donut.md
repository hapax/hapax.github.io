**November 4, 2020.** *The central dogma of flat earthism would seem
to be that the earth is flat. More recently, though, heretics have
appeared on the scene claiming the earth is shaped like a donut. In
this post, I'll explain how you can have your donut and eat it too:
the earth could be both flat and toroidal, by embedding in higher
dimensions! I'll examine some amusing implications and (decisive)
objections to this model.*

#### Introduction

From 1519--1522, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan circumnavigated
the world around a rough circle of latitude.
Led by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, in 1979--1982, the
[Transglobe Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transglobe_Expedition)
completed the first longitudinal circumnavigation by ground transport
(i.e. no planes).
So, if we draw latitude and longitude on a rectangle (the Mercator projection), it seems the earth
has *periodic boundary* conditions.

There are two possibilities consistent with these expeditions.
First, the top and bottom are glued, and the left and right glued
separately., we
As illustrated below, doing this gluing yields a *donut*.
If, on the other hand, we explain the periodicity by gluing all four
sides together, we get a surface with the topology of a sphere.
Thus, we are led naturally to consider the sphere and the donut as two
options for the shape of the earth.

The solution involves the fun math factoid that you can embed a torus
in *four* spatial dimensions in such a way that it remains flat.
I'll demonstrate in an elementary way how this works below.
The natural objection is that we live in three dimensions, not four,
so I will talk about a way to localize standard model fields to a
"braneworld" which is more consistent with what we see.
This also helps explain the weakness of gravity.
We'll end with more serious objections which, to my mind, very
definitely rule out the possibility we live in a flat, toroidal braneworld.
