**November 4, 2020.** *For the most part, flat earthers believe that
  the world is flat. More recently, this fringe has itself developed a
  fringe which believe the earth is shaped like a donut. In this post,
  I'll explain why you can have your donut and eat it too, expounding
  a new (and extremely facetious) theory that the earth is a flat torus.*
