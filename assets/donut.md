**November 4, 2020.** *The central dogma of flat earthism would seem
to be that the earth is flat. More recently, though, heretics have
appeared on the scene claiming the earth is shaped like a donut. In
this post, I'll explain how you can have your donut and eat it too:
the earth could be both flat and toroidal, by embedding in higher
dimensions! I'll examine some amusing implications and (decisive)
objections to this model.*

#### Introduction

From 1519--1522, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan circumnavigated
the world around a rough circle of latitude.
Led by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, in 1979--1982, the
[Transglobe Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transglobe_Expedition)
completed the first longitudinal circumnavigation by ground transport
(i.e. no planes).
So, if we draw latitude and longitude on a rectangle (the Mercator projection), it seems the earth
has *periodic boundary* conditions.

There are two possibilities consistent with these expeditions.
First, the top and bottom are glued, and the left and right glued
separately., we
As illustrated below, doing this gluing yields a *donut*.
If, on the other hand, we explain the periodicity by gluing all four
sides together, we get a surface with the topology of a sphere.
Thus, we are led naturally to consider the sphere and the donut as two
options for the shape of the earth.

So much for topology.
The next observation involves *geometry*, the rigid aspects of the
earth's surface like lengths and angles.
Here it is: everywhere we go, the earth looks more or less the same.
This suggests that the *curvature*, or departure from flatness, is the
same everywhere.
Our two topological possibilities lead to two geometric possibilities.
For a closed surface with no holes, the only constant-curvature option
is a uniform sphere.
This is what our earth in fact looks like, up to small changes due to
the equatorial flattening.

What about the donut?
It would seem that the torus cannot be embedded in a
constant-curvature way, and this is indeed true in three dimensions.
The torus will be curved in totally different ways on the outside and
the inside!
On the outside, it is *positively* curved, bulging outwards like a
sphere, and on the inside *negatively* curved like a saddle.
We should in principle be able to detect these changes in curvature,
but we don't.
Does this rule the torus out?

Not quite!
There a sneaky math factoid we can use: you can embed a torus in
*four* spatial dimensions in such a way that it is not only constant
curvature, but flat.
This naturally combines both flat earthism and
donut earthism!
I'll demonstrate how the construction works in an elementary way below.
An obvious objection is that we only see three dimensions, not four,
so I will talk about a way to localize physics to a three-dimensional
"braneworld".
This also helps explain the weakness of gravity.
I'll end with some more serious objections which, to my mind, decisively
rule out the possibility we live in a flat, toroidal braneworld.
