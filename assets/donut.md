**November 4, 2020.** *For the most part, flat earthers believe that
  the world is flat. More recently, this fringe has itself developed a
  fringe, which believes the earth is shaped like a donut. In this post,
  I'll explain why you can have your donut and eat it too: the earth
  could be a flat torus! (To be extremely clear, this is a joke.)*
