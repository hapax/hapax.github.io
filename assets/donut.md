**November 4, 2020.** *The central dogma of flat earthism would seem
to be that the earth is flat. More recently, though, heretics have
appeared on the scene claiming the earth is shaped like a donut. In
this post, I'll explain how you can have your donut and eat it too:
the earth could be both flat and toroidal, by embedding in higher
dimensions. The extra direction can be rendered invisible with a
confining potential, but we'll end with more serious objections which,
to my mind, very definitely rule out the possibility we live in a
flat, toroidal braneworld.*

#### Introduction



The solution involves the fun math factoid that you can embed a torus
in *four* spatial dimensions in such a way that it remains flat.
I'll demonstrate in an elementary way how this works below.
The natural objection is that we live in three dimensions, not four,
so I will talk about a way to localize standard model fields to a
"braneworld" which is more consistent with what we see.
This also helps explain the weakness of gravity.
