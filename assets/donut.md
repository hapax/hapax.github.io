**November 4, 2020.** *For the most part, flat earthers believe that
  the world is flat. More recently, this fringe has itself developed a
  fringe, which believes the earth is shaped like a donut. In this post,
  I'll explain why you can have your donut and eat it too: the earth
  could be a flat torus! (To be abundantly clear, this is a joke.)*

#### Introduction

The central dogma of flat earthism would seem to be that the earth is
flat. More recently, though, heretics have appeared on the scene
claiming the earth is shaped like a donut.
Now, all of these ideas are ridiculous, but flat earthers often
display a sort of perverse ingenuity in evading objections.
But they are not imaginative enough!
In this post, I'll explain how you can have your donut and eat it too:
the earth could be *both* flat and toroidal!

The solution involves the fun math factoid that you can embed a torus
in *four* spatial dimensions in such a way that it remains flat.
I'll demonstrate in an elementary way how this works below.
The natural objection is that we live in three dimensions, not four,
so I will talk about a way to localize standard model fields to a
"braneworld" which is more consistent with what we see.
This also helps explain the weakness of gravity.
We'll end with more serious objections which, to my mind, very
definitely rule out the possibility we live in a flat, toroidal braneworld.
