**October 26, 2020.** *In which I pretend to be Elon Musk, and propose
  to launch rockets into space using vacuum tubes.*

#### 1. Introduction<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Elon Musk is the CEO and founder of SpaceX, a company which sends
rockets into space. Along with engineers at Tesla and SpaceX, he also
proposed a wacky, high-speed alternative to trains: the *hyperloop*,
the pneumatic tube for people. In this post, I conduct an initial
feasibility study for combining these two ideas, and launching rockets
into space with *vertical* hyperloops.
I call this "hyperlaunch".

Since this is merely a feasibility analysis, I will ignore most of the
important engineering problems, and focus on the physics.
And even though I am focusing on the physics, I will adopt an
order-of-magnitude-estimate (oome) philosophy, which I will call
*oomeism*.
I state for the record that "oomeism" and the "hyperlaunch" are very,
very serious business.

The basic idea is simple.
Make a giant cylinder stretching from the

#### 3. The physics<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

With the concept now described, we have some physics to do. Can we
launch anything? How light must it be? What physics are we neglecting?
We'll address all of these, though using a suitably oomeist viewpoint.

### 3.1. The barometric equation<a id="sec-3-1" name="sec-3-1"></a>

In order to understand how much force is supplied to the plunger, we
need to understand how pressure varies with height, and indeed, how
high the atmosphere effectively is for our purposes.
We will start with the simplest model: it is an ideal gas, in
hydrostatic equilibrium, small enough that gravitational acceleration
is constant.
Let's unpack these.
An ideal gas satisfies the ideal gas law,

$$
PV = n k_BT,
$$

where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $n$ is particle number, $k_B
= 1.38 \times 10^{-23}$ in SI units, and $T$ is absolute temperature,
e.g. in Kelvin.
Hydrostatic equilibrium means that
