**October 26, 2020.** *In which I pretend to be Elon Musk, and propose
  to launch rockets into space using vacuum tubes.*

#### 1. Introduction<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Elon Musk is the CEO and founder of SpaceX, a company which sends
rockets into space. Along with engineers at Tesla and SpaceX, he also
proposed a wacky, high-speed alternative to trains: the *hyperloop*,
the pneumatic tube for people. In this post, I conduct an initial
feasibility study for combining these two ideas, and launching rockets
into space with *vertical* hyperloops.
I call this "hyperlaunch".

Since this is merely a feasibility analysis, I will ignore most of the
important engineering problems, and focus on the physics.
And even though I am focusing on the physics, I will adopt an
order-of-magnitude-estimate (OOME) philosophy, which I will call
*oomeism*.
I state for the record that "oomeism" and the "hyperlaunch" are very,
very serious business.
