#### Introduction

It is a [running joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox) among mathematicians that there are no boring
numbers, and you can prove it. Let $B$ be the set of boring numbers.
Define $b = \min B$ as the smallest boring number.
But this is a unique property, so $b$ is interesting after all!
