**March 22, 2021.** *Stuff*

#### Introduction

It is a
[running joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox)
among mathematicians that there are no boring numbers, and you can
prove it. Let $B$ be the set of boring numbers. Define $b = \min B$ as
the smallest boring number. But this is a unique property, so $b$ is
interesting after all!
This is a joke, but there is a sting in the tail.
We are implicitly using the fact that "numbers" refers to "positive
whole numbers".
If we weren't, then the *minimum* we used to get our contradiction
wouldn't always work!
