About an hour's bus ride from Nikko station, over Daiya river
and the candy apple arc of Shinkyo bridge, through Nikko's dusty
outskirts, Kiyotaki, then the tunnels and switchbacks which surmount
the Akechidaira plateau, you come to a small town wedged
between a sacred lake and a sacred mountain.
Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) translates to "lake of
the Chinese zen temple", while the mountain, Nantai (男体), means "man's body".
In a perversely literal obedience to the latter, for over a thousand
years, both lake and mountain were closed to horses, cows, and women.

The town is sometimes called Chuzenji, sometimes Okunikko (奥日光, "inner
Nikko"), and in this ambiguity, seems more defined by its proximity to other things than
any properties of its own.
It is in between, or nearby, but never "here". The day my bus
rolls up the mountain and into the carpark, it is swaddled in a
blanket of fog and almost invisible; Chuzenji is in all directions but nowhere to be seen.
Initially, it was no more than a pitstop on my way to the Senjogahara marshland, a wet and sprawling plain 1400 meters above sea
level, covered in hare's-tail cottongrass and rambling boardwalks.
But the mass of cloud has settled onto the wetland as well as the lake,
dampening my plans for a picturesque hike, so I decide to explore the town instead.

Chuzenji is strung along a loose "V" between two waterfalls and the
eponymous buddhist temple, cluttering the
intervening lakeside with jetties, hotels, souvenir stores,
embassies, and mom-and-pop kitchens, in various states of closure and disrepair.
Off-season it may be, but for the lugubrious pensions and noodle
shops, it is off-season forever.
With its qualities of supernumerary variety and fantastic decay,
Chuzenji reminds me of flotsam, washed up on the shore by the 80s boom
and left to rot in the "lost decade" of the 90s, with its sharp
decline in liquidity and domestic tourism.
These crumbling facades chart not only the ravages of time, but the rise and fall of the Nikkei.

By the cruise terminal, I pause and imagine the 80s daytrippers pouring in
from the suburbs of Tokyo, all chinos and sweatpants and big hair.
I zoom in on one family, a mother, father, two sisters and a younger brother.
They are restless after the bus ride and now flit wordlessly about the
streets to watch the glassblower at work, or unironically chow down on Nikko
World Heritage Cheese Eggs.
After some mild negotiation (Okaasan wants to visit the temple), they
take two of the cygnine pleasure crafts for a whirl on the lake, and Otousan
falls in the water; guileless laughter.
Clumsy Otousan!
Of course, it is all a mirage, like a Coke ad or an asset price
bubble, shattered by the reality of a beached and headless swan, a
perfect specimen of the Chuzenji grotesque.

I continue taking in the spectacle of ruin.
But I wonder: what *is* ruin?
Is it mere grotesquerie, like the swan, things disharmonious
in the arrangement of their parts?
That would make ruin an aesthetic phenomenon like beauty.
But disharmony is different from beauty, since easier
to achieve; to paraphrase the opening lines of *Anna Karenina*, or the
second law of thermodynamics, there are many more ways to fall apart than
look good.
Harmony is a vanishing sliver of phase space.
Ruin is the freedom of matter from our conceits of order.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/photos/lake8.png" />
</div>
</figure>

This democratic view of decay suits the parts, who are ignorant
of ruin and know only combinatorics, but the assemblage does not have this luxury.
When an organism is sufficiently ruined, it dies; when enough shops
close, and people move away, so does a town.
As an ordered composite, arranged in ever greater hierarchies of order, we
operate in tiny slivers of phase space, and if entropy is maximized,
we will cease to exist.
Viewed this way, ruin becomes a statement about the perishability of
ordered being.

    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/photos/lake20.png" />

Curiously, Thomas Aquinas saw in this perishability a proof of God's
existence.
In his *Tertia Via*, he argues that the world is full of perishable beings,
who exist for a time, but by processes of death, corruption and
change, later cease to exist.
Something imperishable must underwrite this process; it certainly
cannot be the perishable beings themselves, since they pass out of
existence, and the power to effect change with them.
Thus, Aquinas arrives at the notion of God as a metaphysical principle of ruin.

Lake Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) literally means "Lake of the Chinese Zen
