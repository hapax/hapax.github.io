About an hour's bus ride from Nikko station, over Daiya river
and the candy apple arc of Shinkyo bridge, through Nikko's dusty
outskirts, Kiyotaki, then the tunnels and switchbacks which surmount
the Akechidaira plateau, you come to a small town wedged
between a sacred lake and a sacred mountain.
Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) translates to "lake of
the Chinese zen temple", while the mountain, Nantai (男体), means "man's body".
In a perversely literal obedience to the latter, for over a thousand
years, the region was closed to horses, cows, and women.

The town is sometimes called Chuzenji, sometimes Okunikko (奥日光, "inner
Nikko"), and even in this ambiguity, seems more defined by its proximity to other things than
any properties of its own.
It is in between, or nearby, but never "here". The day my bus
rolls up the mountain and into the carpark, it is swaddled in a
blanket of fog and almost invisible; Chuzenji is in all directions but nowhere to be seen.
Initially, it is no more than a pitstop on my way to the Senjogahara
marshland, a sprawling plain of hare's-tail cottongrass and rambling
boardwalks 1400 meters above sea level.
But the mass of cloud has settled onto the wetland as well as the lake,
extinguishing my plans for a hike. I decide to explore the town instead.

Chuzenji is strung out in a loose "V" between two waterfalls and the
eponymous buddhist temple, and clutters the
intervening lakeside with jetties, hotels, souvenir stores,
embassies, and mom-and-pop kitchens, in various states of closure and disrepair.
Off-season it may be, but for the lugubrious pensions and noodle
shops, it is off-season forever.
With its qualities of supernumerary variety and fantastic decay,
Chuzenji reminds me of flotsam, washed up on the shore by the 80s boom
and left to rot in the "lost decade" of the 90s, with its sharp
decline in liquidity and domestic tourism.
These crumbling facades chart not only the ravages of time, but the rise and fall of the Nikkei.

By the cruise terminal, I pause and imagine the 80s daytrippers pouring in
from the suburbs of Tokyo, all chinos and sweatpants and big hair.
I zoom in on one family, a mother, father, two sisters and a younger brother.
They are restless after the bus ride and now flit wordlessly about the
streets to watch the glassblower at work, or unironically chow down on Nikko
World Heritage Cheese Eggs.
After some negotiation (Okaasan wants to visit the temple), they
take two of the cygnine pleasure crafts for a whirl on the lake, and Otousan
falls in the water; guileless laughter.
Clumsy Otousan!
Of course, it is all a mirage, like a Coke ad or an asset price
bubble, shattered by the reality of a headless swan,
a perfect specimen of the Chuzenji grotesque.

    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/photos/lake2v2.png" />

Among these melancholy and disquieting creatures, I begin to ponder
the nature of ruin.
Is it mere grotesquerie, like the swan, things disharmonious
in the arrangement of their parts?
That would make it an aesthetic judgment like beauty, and in a
way, ruin *is* beautiful, or at least, arresting in some gropingly analogous fashion.
But disharmony is different from beauty, since easier
to achieve; to paraphrase the opening lines of *Anna Karenina*, or the
second law of thermodynamics, there are many more ways to fall apart
than not.
Harmony is a vanishing sliver of phase space; ruin is the freedom of matter from human conceit.

Now, this democratic view suits the parts, the crumbling staircase and the
peeling wallpaper, who are ignorant
of decline and know only combinatorics.
But the assemblage does not have this luxury:
when an organism is sufficiently disarranged, it dies; when a building
decays and collapses, it is no more; if the daytrippers stay home,
and the swans lose their heads, and folk move away, a
bustling settlement becomes a ghost town.
Ordered composites can only exist and operate in tiny slivers of phase space.
Ruin is a statement about the perishability of
ordered being.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/photos/lake8.png" />
</div>
</figure>

Curiously, the great theologian Thomas Aquinas saw in this
perishability a proof of the existence of God.
In his *Tertia Via* (Third Way), he argues that the world is full of
perishable orderings---things like
boats and people and economic growth---which come into being for a time,
but by the agency of death, corruption and change, go out of it again,
through a sort of revolving door of ontology.
So far, he is in agreement with Heraclitus, the pre-Socratic
who pithily observed that nothing endures but change.

Here, Aquinas makes his bold departure.
There is change, there is flux, there is destruction; very well.
But what (Aquinas asks) underwrites all that, and revolves the door of ontology?
It cannot be the perishable beings themselves, since they
disappear and take their causal powers with them.
Could a mortal be responsible for Mortality, or something
contingent for Contingency itself?
Certainly not, he concludes.
Something necessary and immortal must keep the machineries of decay
ticking over.
This Third Way is no route to a Judeo-Christian Father,
wrathful or provident as the various Testaments would have us believe;
rather, it establishes God as a metaphysical principle of ruin.

Is there a theodicy of ruin? Some way to reconcile ourselves with
contingency and the true vastness of phase space?
Here, in one of His dwelling places, I may have the chance
to find out.
Mist plays over the remains of a housefire, and draws my eye up,
towards the hidden peak of Nantai.
I am cold. I have no cell reception. I will need a place to sleep.

I passed a *konbini* in the cruise terminal, so I walk back and dawdle in
the snack aisle, wracked by performative indecision, which search
for hotels on the wifi.
A balding clerk listens to the baseball---from what I can tell,
the Swallows are leading the Baystars---and watches me with quiet indulgence.
He has nowhere to be and all the time in the world. He yawns, switches
stations; I can play at browsing snacks for as long as I like.
Little Forest Inn has rooms.
Incidentally, this is what forever feels like: a balding clerk
listening to baseball scores, while a gaijin picks up one brand of novelty
pretzel after another after another, all with the imperturbable slowness of a
dream.
A convenience store is a good place to visit eternity.

On the northern shore, Chuzenji has a single backstreet, pitched up
the hill from the middle of the "V" and running like a droplet back
into the lake as the road crawls westward.
Little Forest Inn is near this westward fall, cushioned between an
enormous shed and an empty weedlot.
I leave the convenience store, now armed with an array of
pretzels, and cut up a concrete ramp to the backstreet.
The weedlot really is a little forest in poetic apposition to the
guesthouse, and I clamber over a fence and down a stone wall to take in
its petrichor and glistening tussock before checking in.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/photos/lake9.png" />
</div>
</figure>

Back at street level, the Little Forest presents an enigma of locked
and unmarked doors.
I pick one at random and knock quietly; nothing. I knock harder.
After a few minutes, a blob appears behind the frosted glass,
resolving as the door opens into a thin and slightly frayed woman in her late 30s.
She conducts me inside, and, as if to certify a position of which she
is unsure, shuffles behind a curtain to then re-emerge and face me
with exaggerated formality over the counter.
Between her broken English and my broken Japanese, a room is booked; I
tramp upstairs to deposit my backpack and pretzels.
As I come back down the stairs, a toddler appears on the counter,
smiling hugely, and hands me a set of random keys.
The woman materialises out of the gloom to retrieve toddler and keys,
muttering apologies, but not without suppressing a smile of her own.
Disorder is also the condition for life.

At first, life seems as incongruous as the teapot I found in the
remains of the housefire, an island of order in a sea of chaos.
But physicist Jeremy England has suggested the converse: life is not
the island of order, but the waves lapping at the shore and gradually
dissolving the sand into the ocean, less like the teapot and more like
the blaze that consumed the house.
It is a surface phenomenon, evolved
in accord with thermodynamics not to preserve order but to *convert to
disorder with maximum efficiency*.
England calls this "dissipation-driven adaptation".
With enough order to burn, life could be inevitable.

But even if life thrives at the margins of disorder, this is not a theodicy.
No application of Jarzynski's inequality, however ingenious, can
restore the Library of Alexandria; no judicious separation of
timescales will raise the dead.
Loss is loss is loss.
Physics cannot render mechanism into human value, or expiate from
first principles; these tasks fall to other systems of thought.

I head back down to the main street, no plans in mind, nothing for
life to nibble away at.
By the ramp, England's hypothesis is illustrated by the splendid
wildflowers sprouting through the gravel of a tumbledown plot.
At the back sits a rusty lean-to,

The fact that we may be rushing headlong into it, as a matter of
