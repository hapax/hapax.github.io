About an hour's bus ride from Nikko station, over Daiya river
and the candy apple arc of Shinkyo bridge, through Nikko's dusty
outskirts, Kiyotaki, then the tunnels and switchbacks which surmount
the Akechidaira plateau, you come to a small town wedged
between a sacred lake and a sacred mountain.
Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) translates to "lake of
the Chinese zen temple", while the mountain, Nantai (男体), means "man's body".
In a perversely literal obedience to the latter, for over a thousand
years, this sacred lake and mountain were closed to horses, cows, and women.

The town is sometimes called Chuzenji, sometimes Okunikko (奥日光, "inner
Nikko"), and even in this ambiguity, seems more defined by its proximity to other things than
any properties of its own.
It is in between, or nearby, but never "here". The day my bus
rolls up the mountain and into the carpark, it is swaddled in a
blanket of fog and almost invisible; Chuzenji is in all directions but nowhere to be seen.
Initially, it is no more than a pitstop on my way to the Senjogahara
marshland, a sprawling plain of hare's-tail cottongrass and rambling
boardwalks 1400 meters above sea level.
But the mass of cloud has settled onto the wetland as well as the lake,
extinguishing my plans for a hike. I decide to explore the town instead.

Chuzenji is strung out in a loose "V" between two waterfalls and the
eponymous buddhist temple, and clutters the
intervening lakeside with jetties, hotels, souvenir stores,
embassies, and mom-and-pop kitchens, in various states of closure and disrepair.
Off-season it may be, but for the lugubrious pensions and noodle
shops, it is off-season forever.
With its qualities of supernumerary variety and fantastic decay,
Chuzenji reminds me of flotsam, washed up on the shore by the 80s boom
and left to rot in the "lost decade" of the 90s, with its sharp
decline in liquidity and domestic tourism.
These crumbling facades chart not only the ravages of time, but the rise and fall of the Nikkei.

By the cruise terminal, I pause and imagine the 80s daytrippers pouring in
from the suburbs of Tokyo, all chinos and sweatpants and big hair.
I zoom in on one family, a mother, father, two sisters and a younger brother.
They are restless after the bus ride and now flit wordlessly about the
streets to watch the glassblower at work, or unironically chow down on Nikko
World Heritage Cheese Eggs.
After some mild negotiation (Okaasan wants to visit the temple), they
take two of the cygnine pleasure crafts for a whirl on the lake, and Otousan
falls in the water; guileless laughter.
Clumsy Otousan!
Of course, it is all a mirage, like a Coke ad or an asset price
bubble, shattered by the reality of a headless swan;
a perfect specimen of the Chuzenji grotesque.

Among these melancholy and disquieting creatures, I begin to ponder
the nature of ruin.
Is it mere grotesquerie, like the swan, things disharmonious
in the arrangement of their parts?
That would make it an aesthetic phenomenon like beauty, and in a
way, ruin *is* beautiful, or at least, arresting in some gropingly analogous way.
But disharmony is different from beauty, since easier
to achieve; to paraphrase the opening lines of *Anna Karenina*, or the
second law of thermodynamics, there are many more ways to fall apart
than to look good.
Harmony is a vanishing sliver of phase space. Ruin frees matter from the conceit of order.

Now, this democratic view suits the parts, the crumbling staircase and the
peeling wallpaper, who are ignorant
of ruin and know only combinatorics.
But the assemblage does not have this luxury:
when an organism is sufficiently ruined, it dies; when a building
decays and collapses, it is no more; if the daytrippers stay home,
and the swans lose their heads, and enough people move away, the place
becomes a ghost town.
Ordered composites can only exist and operate in tiny slivers of phase space.
Viewed this way, ruin becomes a statement about the perishability of
ordered being.

Curiously, the great theologian Thomas Aquinas saw in this
perishability a proof of the existence of God.
In his *Tertia Via* (Third Way), he argues that the world is full of
perishable beings, or more generally perishable order, things like
civilizations, temples, people, animals, religions, even relationships and moods.
They exist for a time, but by the operation of death, corruption and change, exist no longer.
Something imperishable must underwrite this process; it certainly
cannot be the perishable beings themselves, since they pass out of
existence, and take whatever causative powers they effected with them.
Could be a mortal be responsibility for Mortality, or something
contingent for Contingency itself?
Certainly not, he concludes.
Something necessary and immortal must keep those machineries of decay
ticking over.
To my mind, the Third Way is no route to a Judeo-Christian Father,
wrathful or provident; rather, it enshrines God as a metaphysical principle of ruin.

Lake Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) literally means "Lake of the Chinese Zen
