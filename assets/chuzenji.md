About an hour's bus ride from Nikko station, over Daiya river
and the candy apple arc of Shinkyo bridge, through Nikko's dusty
outskirts, Kiyotaki, and up and around the convulsed mass of the
Akechidaira plateau, the traveller arrives at an onsen town
wedged between a sacred lake and a sacred mountain.
The name of the lake, Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖), literally means "lake of
the Chinese zen temple", while the mountain, Nantai (男体), translates to "man's body".
In perversely literal obedience to the latter, both were closed to
women, horses and cows for over a thousand years.

The town is called variously Chuzenji and Okunikko (奥日光, "inner
Nikko"), and seems defined by its proximity to other things than by
any properties of its own.
It gives the lake a crust of jetties, tumbledown hotels, souvenir
shops, and strangely large emporia in various states of disrepair;
washed up on shore, a residue of better times.

Its chief attraction is the eponymous buddhist temple and its statue of Kannon, the goddess of mercy.
