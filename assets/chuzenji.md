About an hour's bus ride from Nikko station, over Daiya river
and the candy apple arc of Shinkyo bridge, through Nikko's dusty
outskirts, Kiyotaki, then tunnels and switchbacks which surmount the Akechidaira plateau, you come to a small town wedged
between a sacred lake and a sacred mountain.
Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) translates to "lake of
the Chinese zen temple", while the mountain, Nantai (男体), means "man's body".
In a perversely literal obedience to the latter, for over a thousand
years, both lake and mountain were closed to horses, cows, and women.

The town is sometimes called Chuzenji, sometimes Okunikko (奥日光, "inner
Nikko"), and even in this ambiguity, seems more defined by its proximity to other things than
any properties of its own.
It is in between, or nearby, but never "here". The day my bus
rolls up the mountain and into the carpark, it is swaddled in a
blanket of fog and almost invisible; Chuzenji is in all directions but nowhere to be seen.
Initially, it was no more than a pitstop on my way to the Senjogahara marshland, a wet and sprawling plain 1400 meters above sea
level, covered in hare's-tail cottongrass and rambling boardwalks.
But the mass of cloud has settled onto the wetland as well as the lake,
dampening my plans for a picturesque hike. I decide to explore the town instead.

Chuzenji is strung along a loose "V" from one
pretty waterfall to another to the eponymous temple, cluttering the lakeside in
between with jetties, hotels, souvenir stores,
embassies, mom-and-pop kitchens, and oversized emporia,
in various states of closure and disrepair.
Off-season it may be, but for the lugubrious pensions and noodle
shops, it is off-season forever.
With its qualities of supernumerary variety and fantastic decay,
Chuzenji looks like flotsam, washed up on the shore by the 80s boom
and left to rot in the "lost decade" of the 90s, with its sharp
decline in liquidity and domestic tourism.
These crumbling facades chart the rise and fall of the Nikkei along
with the ravages of time.

By the cruise terminal, I pause and imagine the daytrippers pouring in
from the suburbs of Tokyo, all chinos and sweatpants and big hair.
I zoom in on one family, a mother, father, two sisters and a younger brother.
They are restless after the bus ride and now flit wordlessly about the
streets to watch the glassblower at work, or unironically chow down on Nikko
World Heritage Cheese Eggs.
After some mild negotiation (Okaasan wants to visit the temple), they
take two of the cygnine pleasure crafts for a whirl on the lake, and Otousan
falls in the water; guileless laughter.
Clumsy Otousan!
Of course, it is all a mirage, like a Coke ad or an asset price
bubble, shattered now by the reality of a beached and headless swan,
an original Chuzenji grotesque.

Lake Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) literally means "Lake of the Chinese Zen
