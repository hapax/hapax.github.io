##### The mountain shrine<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

About an hour's bus ride from Nikko station, over Daiya river
and the candy apple arc of the Shinkyo bridge, through Nikko's dusty
outskirts, Kiyotaki and up and around the convulsed mass of the
Akechidaira plateau, the traveller finds Chuzenji (中禅寺), a
deteriorating tourist town nestled between a sacred lake and a sacred mountain.
Lake Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) literally means "Lake of the Chinese Zen
Temple, while Mt. Nantai (男体) is "man's body".
Both were closed to women and horses for over a thousand years.
