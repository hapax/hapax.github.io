#### Chuzenji<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

About an hour's bus ride from Nikko station, over Daiya river
and the candy apple arc of Shinkyo bridge, through Nikko's dusty
outskirts, Kiyotaki, then tunnels and misty switchbacks up and
around the convulsed base of the Akechidaira plateau, you come to a
small town wedged between a sacred lake and a sacred mountain.
Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) translates to "lake of
the Chinese zen temple", while the mountain, Nantai (男体), means "man's body".
In a perversely literal obedience, for over a thousand
years, both lake and mountain were closed to women, horses and cows.

The town is sometimes called Chuzenji, sometimes Okunikko (奥日光, "inner
Nikko"), and even in this small ambiguity, seems more defined by its shifting proximity to other things than by
any properties of its own.
It is in between, or around, but never "here", and the day I arrived,
the town was swaddled in a blanket of fog and almost invisible; I was
in it, but it was nowhere to be seen.
Chuzenji was initially no more than a pitstop on my way to the Senjogahara marshland, a wet and sprawling plain 1400 meters above sea
level, covered in hare's-tail cottongrass and rambling boardwalks.
But the mass of cloud had settled onto the adjoining plateaus, and
I would see very little of the picturesque wetlands. I decided to explore
the town instead.

Chuzenji strings out a loose "V", angling around the lake from one
pretty waterfall to another to the eponymous temple, and dots the
lakeside with jetties, tumbledown hotels, souvenir stores, high-walled
embassies, mom-and-pop kitchens, and oversized emporia,
in various states of disrepair.
It is a tourist town washed up on the shore, a residue of the 80s boom which
freed up liquidity for domestic travel, and came crashing down when
the asset price bubble burst in the 90s.
Its crumbling facades chart the rise and fall of the Nikkei.
