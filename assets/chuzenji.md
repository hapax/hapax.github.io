About an hour's bus ride from Nikko station, over Daiya river
and the candy apple arc of Shinkyo bridge, through Nikko's dusty
outskirts, Kiyotaki, winding though tunnels and misty switchbacks up and
around the convulsed base of the Akechidaira plateau, you arrive at a
small town wedged between a sacred lake and a sacred mountain.
Chuzenjiko (中禅寺湖) translates to "lake of
the Chinese zen temple", while the mountain, Nantai (男体), means "man's body".
In perversely literal obedience to the latter, for over a thousand

The town is called variously Chuzenji and Okunikko (奥日光, "inner

temple, dotting the lakeside with jetties, tumbledown hotels, souvenir stores,
high-walled embassies, mom-and-pop kitchens, and oversized emporia,
all in states of disrepair.
It is a tourist town washed up on the shore, a residue of the 80s boom which
freed up liquidity for domestic travel, and came crashing down when
the asset price bubble burst in the 90s.
Its crumbling facades chart the rise and fall of the Nikkei.

The town was initially no more than a pitstop on my way to the
Senjogahara marshland, a sprawling, picturesque wetland 1400 meters above sea
level, covered in hare's-tail cottongrass and spiderwebbed with
boardwalk.
But fog had descended on the lake and the adjoining plataeaus, so

In a sense, visiting the lake is a particularly vivid lesson

a residue of better times, the
80s boom and the liquidity it freed up for domestic tourism, and the
