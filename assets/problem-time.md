#### Is life easier as a solipsist?

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I discussed *presentism*, the view that only the present exists.
I argued that, though compelling at the level of folk psychology,
presentism is ultimately unable to explain change, and our sense data
are telling us about brain states rather than metaphysics.

But perhaps this is a bit too quick.
