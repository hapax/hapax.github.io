#### Brain states and metaphysics

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I discussed *presentism*, the view that only the present exists.
I argued that, though compelling at the level of folk psychology,
presentism is ultimately unable to explain change, and our sense data
are telling us about brain states rather than metaphysics.
But perhaps this is a bit too quick.
I think our brain states *do* tell us something deep about the
universe, by virtue of the properties they have.

An obvious but nevertheless deep fact is that *we can remember the
past but not the future.*
Put differently, our current brain state seems to be influenced by
past events, but not future ones.
At a folk psychology level, being "lodged" in the present moment gives
rise to presentism, and being "uninfluenced" by future events gives
rise to the doctrine of free will, and the appeal of "growing block"
ontologies for spacetime.
I think none of these conclusions is licensed by the properties of our brain states.
But being lodged in the present seems like a trivially explicable
thing, while only being able to remember the past does not.

#### The appeal of solipsism

Presentism, free will, and growing blocks all represent a
type of *solipsism*.
A solipsist proper treats the fact that they cannot experience other
minds as conclusive evidence that other minds do not exist.
A presentist treats the fact that they only experience the
present as evidence only the present exists.
Similarly, an enthusiast of growing blocks or free will imagines the
future (or particularly their future decisions) do not exist since
they have yet to encounter them.
To be sure, a growing blocker is more liberal than a presentist, since
they believe in the past, but this is like a "friendly" solipsist who
believe only in the existence of people they have met.

Solipsism would not be crazy if you were the only sentient being in a
world of bugs.
In that case, you would have no reason to believe that the bugs had
anything like your inner experience.
But in a world of beings whose complexity of behaviour resembles
yours, an inability to directly access their mental states does not
make the existence of these mental states suspect.
In fact, mental states remain the best explanation for that behaviour.
Solipsists may be good Cartesians,
