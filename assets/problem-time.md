#### Brain states and metaphysics

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I discussed *presentism*, the view that only the present exists.
I argued that, though compelling at the level of folk psychology,
presentism is ultimately unable to explain change, and our sense data
are telling us about brain states rather than metaphysics.
But perhaps this is a bit too quick.
I think our brain states *do* tell us something deep about the
universe, by virtue of the properties they have.

An obvious but nevertheless deep fact is that *we can remember the
past but not the future.*
Put differently, our current brain state seems to be influenced by
past events, but not future ones.
At a folk psychology level, being "lodged" in the present moment gives
rise to presentism, and being "uninfluenced" by future events gives
rise to the doctrine of free will, and the appeal of "growing block"
ontologies for spacetime.
I think none of these conclusions is licensed by the properties of our brain states.
But being lodged in the present seems like a trivially explicable
thing, while only being able to remember the past does not.

#### Temporal solipsism

Presentism, free will, and growing blocks all represent a
type of *solipsism*.
A solipsist proper treats the fact that they cannot experience other
minds as conclusive evidence that other minds do not exist.
A presentist treats the fact that only experience the
present as evidence no other times exist.
Similarly, an enthusiast of growing blocks or free will treats the
future as non-existent because they have yet to encounter it.
Growing blockers are a bit more liberal, however; they are prepared to
treat the past as existing since it appears to "create" the present
and appears fixed.
They are like "friendly" solipsists, who believe only in the existence
of people they have met.

Solipsism has its advantages and disadvantages.
It does
