#### Brain states and metaphysics

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I discussed *presentism*, the view that only the present exists.
I argued that, though compelling at the level of folk psychology,
presentism is ultimately unable to explain change, and our sense data
are telling us about brain states rather than metaphysics.
But perhaps this is a bit too quick.
I think our brain states *do* tell us something deep about the
universe, by virtue of the properties they have.

An obvious but nevertheless deep fact is that *we can remember the
past but not the future.*
Put differently, our current brain state seems to be influenced by
past events, but not future ones.
At the level of folk epistemology, being "lodged" in the present
moment gives rise to presentism, and being "uninfluenced" by future
events gives rise to the doctrine of free will, and the appeal of
"growing block" ontologies for spacetime, where the future does not
yet exist.
I think none of these conclusions is licensed by the properties of our brain states.
But being lodged in the present seems like a trivially explicable
thing, while only being able to remember the past is not.

#### Temporal solipsism

Let's pause for a moment and untangle a common thread joining these
ideas.
Presentism, free will, and growing blocks all represent a
type of *solipsism*.
A solipsist proper treats the fact that they cannot experience other
minds as conclusive evidence that other minds do not exist.
A presentist treats the fact that they only experience the
present as evidence only the present exists.
Similarly, an enthusiast of growing blocks or free will imagines the
future (or particularly their future decisions) do not exist since
they have yet to encounter them.
To be sure, a growing blocker is more liberal than a presentist, since
they believe in the past, but this is like a "friendly" solipsist who
believe only in the existence of people they have met.

Solipsism would not be crazy if you were the only sentient being in a
world of amoebae or dust.
You would not need a theory of mind to explain their behaviour.
But in a world of beings whose behavioural complexity matches our own,
mental states we cannot access remain the best explanation for their
behaviour.
Solipsists may be good Cartesians, retaining only those ontological
commitments that might not be spoofed by a malicious Cartesian demon,
but they are terrible scientists.
Solipsism does not appeal because it is explanatory, but because it is
all that survives the scorched-earth epistemic program of Cartesian doubt.

Temporally speaking, we do not live in a universe of amoebae.
We live in a spacetime continuum where different temporal slices obey
the same laws of physics, namely the laws of general relativity (at
large scales).
Like humans, they *look the same from the outside*.
A paranoid Cartesian might say: things look different from in here, so
they are different.
The scientist says: they look the same from the outside, and the best
explanation is that they look the same from the inside too.

#### Outside in

Let's return to our original question, namely, to what extent brain
states license metaphysical conclusions.
Solipsists, presentists, free willers and growing blockers take
