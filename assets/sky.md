**December 26, 2029.** *Why is the sky blue? And why is snow white?*

#### What color is the sky?

The Rayleigh scattering cross-section falls off with wavelength as
$\sigma = A/\lambda^4$.
The spectral radiance $R(\lambda, T)$ at temperature $T$, which is the
radiant intensity per unit wavelength, obeys Planck's law

$$
R(\lambda, T) = \frac{B}{\lambda^5(e^{\hbar/kT\lambda} - 1)}.
$$

Define $x = \hbar/kT\lambda$.
The colour of the sky will maximize the product of the blackbody
radiance spectrum coming from the sun and the Rayleigh scattering
cross-section:

$$
f_T(x) = \frac{C x^9}{e^{x} - 1}.
$$

To find the maximum, we simply differentiate and set to $0$:

$$
f'_T(x) = 
$$
