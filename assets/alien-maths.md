#### Linguistic relativism in brief

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
We cut nature up, organize it into
concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are
parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that
holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns
of our language.
</span>

<!-- We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The
categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do
not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the
contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions
which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the
linguistic systems of our minds. -->

Language, it seems, is naturally tied to our view of reality.
The Inuit have
[many more root words for snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow)
than exist in English, and according to some linguists,
the
[Hopi language reflects a different conception of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_time_controversy).
The claim that language affects our perception of reality is called
*linguistic relativism*, though the term encompasses a morass of
distinctions I won't enter into.

Perhaps the sharpest version of the hypothesis is that
[colour words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate)
reflects cultural differences in the perception of colour.
This ties into a 19th century prediliction for making cognitive
judgments on the basis of style.
For instance, the paucity of colour words in the epics of Homer led
British politician William Gladstone to write that

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
...the organ of color and its impressions were but partially
developed among the Greeks of the heroic age.
</span>

Pomposity and racism aside, there is a scientific thesis
here.
In fact, experiments by cognitive linguists suggest that colour
terminology *does* lead to differential performance in tasks involving
remembering and categorising colours.
But the interpretation of these experiments remains controversial.

#### Cognition, language and culture

From the comfortable armchair of a dilettante, the controversy seems
amusingly overblown.
Would anyone really be surprised to learn that there are more words
for snow in Inuktitut than Amharic?
This seems about as shocking as the existence of the periodic table.
And I would expect Inuit hunters to outperform most Europeans in tasks
involving fine discriminations between types of snow since, like a
chemist, they are trained to do so.
Survival *depends* on measurable cognitive differences.
<!-- There is every reason to suppose there are measurable cognitive
differences; survival depends on it. -->

But these finer distinctions, if they exist, do not embody an *arbitrary*
"agreement that holds throughout the speech community".
<!-- Certainly it is an agreement, but it not an arbitrary one.-->
Just like the periodic table, linguistic differences often reflect
facts about the world we care to pay attention to.
Words tokenise relevant differences in a way that facilitaites
*compression*.
This means it literally takes less bites to say things, and
makes them easier to store and manipulate, facilitating both reasoning
and communication.
But our big brains, combined with the mammalian need for attachment,
lead to human culture, woven marvellously through with its language
games of concept, hierarchy, courtship, religion, and so forth.
<!-- It will also presumably have cultural relevance, with words playing an
important role in the system of concepts, hierarchies, relationships and language
games that human culture is built on.
Tokenises relevant differences is facilitates reasoning and communication. -->

All this suggests that language organically co-evolves with culture
and the cognitive demands of life in a particular time and place.
If we split these forces up and decide on some fixed order of
influence, the cart will be before the horse, whichever order we choose!
<!--Linguistic relativism is wrong, not because language does not affect
thought, but rather, because they organically co-evolve.-->
Linguistic universalism, relativism's opposite number, seems to me to
make the same error of unidirectional generalisation.
A mnemonic is a way of shaping cognition with language, and teaching
is (in part) the mnemonic of a whole culture: a process of
enculturation and cognitive bootstrapping via language.
<!--(Of course, teaching has a strongly social aspect as well, but the -->
<!--point is that the influence is sometimes relatively unilateral, -->
<!--pace universalism.)-->
