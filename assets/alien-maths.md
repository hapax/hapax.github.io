#### Inverting Sapir-Whorf

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The
categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do
not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the
contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions
which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the
linguistic systems of our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into
concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are
parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that
holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns
of our language.

Language, it seems, is naturally tied to our view of reality.
The inuit have
[many more root words for snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow)
than exist in English, for instance, and according to some linguists,
the
[Hopi language reflects a different conception of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_time_controversy).
The view that language affects our perception of reality is called
*linguistic relativism*, though strictly speaking, this is an umbrella
term covering a morass of distinctions in strength and emphasis.
