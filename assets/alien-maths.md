#### Linguistic relativism in brief

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
We cut nature up, organize it into
concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are
parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that
holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns
of our language.
</span>

<!-- We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The
categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do
not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the
contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions
which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the
linguistic systems of our minds. -->

Language, it seems, is naturally tied to our view of reality.
Two infamous examples: according to some linguists, the Inuit have
[more root words for snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow)
than English, while the
[Hopi language reflects a different conception of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_time_controversy).
The claim that language affects our perception of reality is called
*linguistic relativism*. More precisely, "strong" linguistic
relativism states that your languages *determines* your reality, while
"weak" relativism states that your language merely influences your reality.

Perhaps the sharpest version of the hypothesis is that
[colour words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate)
reflects cultural differences in the perception of colour.
This ties into a 19th century prediliction for making cognitive
judgments on the basis of style.
For instance, the paucity of colour words in the epics of Homer led
British politician William Gladstone to write that

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
...the organ of color and its impressions were but partially
developed among the Greeks of the heroic age.
</span>

Pomposity aside, there is a scientific thesis
here.
In fact, experiments by cognitive linguists suggest that colour
terminology *does* lead to differential performance in tasks involving
remembering and categorising colours.
In other words, colour terminology does seem to be tied, in some way, to
measurable differences in perception.
But rather than proving relativism, I think the best way to understand
these experiments is to relinquish the false dichotomy between
relativism and universalism altogether.

#### Language, culture and cognition

<!-- The controversy seems amusingly overblown. -->
Would anyone really be surprised to learn that there are more words
for snow in Inuktitut than Amharic?
This seems about as shocking as the existence of the periodic table.
I would expect Inuit hunters to outperform their Ethiopian
counterparts in tasks involving fine-grained perceptions of snow,
since their survival literally depends on it.
Like chemists, there should be measurable cognitive differences as a
result of training, and learning the lingo is part of that training.
<!-- since, like a chemist, they are trained to do so.
Put differently, survival *depends* on measurable cognitive
differences that are plausibly reflected in the language. -->
<!-- There is every reason to suppose there are measurable cognitive
differences; survival depends on it. -->

The periodic table does not embody a mere
"agreement that holds throughout the speech community";
<!-- Certainly it is an agreement, but it not an arbitrary one.-->
rather, it encodes facts about the world chemists care to pay attention to.
I use the word "encode" deliberately, since words *tokenise relevant
differences* in a way that aids compression.
It literally takes less bytes to say things, and lowers the cognitive
burden of storage and manipulation, so both reasoning and
communication are facilitated.

But the referential acts of communication and reasoning are only one
aspect of language.
<!-- Our brain, with its phylogenetic onion skin of drives of abilities, is
 fantastically elaborated in human culture. -->
Our uniquely human drives and need are expressed in culture, woven
marvellously through with its language games of family, hierarchy,
courtship, religion, custom, protocol, and so forth.
<!-- It will also presumably have cultural relevance, with words playing an
important role in the system of concepts, hierarchies, relationships and language
games that human culture is built on.
Tokenises relevant differences is facilitates reasoning and -->
<!-- communication. -->
Language and culture are not synonymous, as founding relativist
Edward Sapir pointed out:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
It is easy to show that language and culture are not intrinsically
associated. Totally unrelated languages share in one culture; closely
related languages—even a single language—belong to distinct culture
spheres.
</span>

But show me a culture without slang, patois, or other vernacular
adaptations, and I will show you an incompetent lexicologist.
Culture and language partially adapt and create each other.

All this suggests that language organically co-evolves with culture
and the cognitive demands of life in a particular time and place.
If we split these forces up and decide on some fixed order of
influence, the cart will be before the horse, whichever order we choose!
<!--Linguistic relativism is wrong, not because language does not affect
thought, but rather, because they organically co-evolve.-->
Linguistic universalism, relativism's opposite number, seems to me to
make the same error of unidirectional generalisation.
A mnemonic is a way of shaping cognition with language, and education
is (in part) the mnemonic of a whole structure of life, a process of
enculturation and cognitive bootstrapping via language.
Clearly, language can influence perception and thought.
<!--(Of course, teaching has a strongly social aspect as well, but the -->
<!--point is that the influence is sometimes relatively unilateral, -->
<!--pace universalism.)-->

#### Cognitive relativism and the inner life of bats

While the version of linguistic universalism just outlined is wrong,
*cognitive universalism* (closer to what most universalists believe)
is more defensible.
Human brains don't magically change when we cross cultural or racial
boundaries, and indeed, language and culture can be viewed as *interfaces*
between the IO of reality and our relatively invariant cognitive hardware.
Interfaces differ, since reality differs (sub-Saharan Africa is not
Nunangat), and even for the same local conditions, the choice of interface is radically non-unique.
But if linguistic relativism is a claim that language changes our
brains in any way *other than* the usual
[Hebbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory) fashion, then
it is clearly wrong.
Similarly, if universalism claims that language *cannot* change our
brains in a Hebbian fashion, it is clearly wrong.

Cognitive universalism within the species seems plausible.
But between species, we expect a form of *cognitive relativism* to
hold.
A dog snuffling around in the undergrowth, a bat navigating by
sonar, and a human piloting a jet engine, are experiencing the world
in different ways; each "sees" things the other cannot, and is
afforded new possibilities for action as a result.
As with language, we can distinguish two forms of
cognitive relativism.
The strong form states that your brain (or cognitive architecture)
determines your reality, and that different species will have
"incommensurable" experiences.
This is similar to claims of linguistic and cultural
incommensurability.

The most famous argument for strong cognitive relativism is
Thomas Nagel's
[*What is it like to be a bat?*](http://www.philosopher.eu/others-writings/nagel-what-is-it-like-to-be-a-bat/).
In fact, Nagel wants to establish the different claim that mind in
general is different from brain, and that there is an interior aspect to
consciousness that cannot be captured by reductive explanation. But his
argument relies on strong cognitive relativism, and the
incommensurability of human and chiropteran experience.
As he puts it:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
But bat sonar, though clearly a form of perception, is not similar in
its operation to any sense that we possess, and there is no reason to
suppose that it is subjectively like anything we can experience or
imagine. This appears to create difficulties for the notion of what it
is like to be a bat.
