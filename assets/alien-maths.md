#### Linguistic relativism in brief

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
We cut nature up, organize it into
concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are
parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that
holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns
of our language.
</span>

<!-- We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The
categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do
not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the
contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions
which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the
linguistic systems of our minds. -->

Language, it seems, is naturally tied to our view of reality.
The Inuit have
[more root words for snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow)
than English, and according to some linguists,
the
[Hopi language reflects a different conception of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_time_controversy).
The claim that language affects our perception of reality is called
*linguistic relativism*. More precisely, "strong" linguistic
relativism states that your languages *determines* your reality, while
"weak" relativism states that your language merely influences your reality.

Perhaps the sharpest version of the hypothesis is that
[colour words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate)
reflects cultural differences in the perception of colour.
This ties into a 19th century prediliction for making cognitive
judgments on the basis of style.
For instance, the paucity of colour words in the epics of Homer led
British politician William Gladstone to write that

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
...the organ of color and its impressions were but partially
developed among the Greeks of the heroic age.
</span>

Pomposity aside, there is a scientific thesis
here.
In fact, experiments by cognitive linguists suggest that colour
terminology *does* lead to differential performance in tasks involving
remembering and categorising colours.
In other words, colour terminology does seem to be tied, in some way, to
measurable differences in perception.
But rather than proving relativism, I think the best way to understand
these experiments is to relinquish the false dichotomy between
relativism and universalism altogether.

#### Language, culture and cognition

<!-- The controversy seems amusingly overblown. -->
Would anyone really be surprised to learn that there are more words
for snow in Inuktitut than Amharic?
This seems about as shocking as the existence of the periodic table.
I would expect Inuit hunters to outperform their Ethiopian
counterparts in tasks involving fine-grained perceptions of snow,
since their survival literally depends on it.
Like chemists, there should be measurable cognitive differences as a
result of training, with the mental effort of correctly learning the
use of language part of that training.
<!-- since, like a chemist, they are trained to do so.
Put differently, survival *depends* on measurable cognitive
differences that are plausibly reflected in the language. -->
<!-- There is every reason to suppose there are measurable cognitive
differences; survival depends on it. -->

The periodic table does not embody a mere
"agreement that holds throughout the speech community";
<!-- Certainly it is an agreement, but it not an arbitrary one.-->
rather, it encodes facts about the world chemists care to pay attention to.
I use the word "encode" deliberately, since words *tokenise relevant
differences* in a way that aids compression.
It literally takes less bytes to say things, and lowers the cognitive
burden of storage and manipulation, so reasoning and communication are
both facilitated.

But our big brains, combined with the mammalian need for attachment,
lead to human culture, woven marvellously through with its language
games of family, hierarchy, courtship, religion, custom, protocol, and so forth.
<!-- It will also presumably have cultural relevance, with words playing an
important role in the system of concepts, hierarchies, relationships and language
games that human culture is built on.
Tokenises relevant differences is facilitates reasoning and communication. -->
All this suggests that language organically co-evolves with culture
and the cognitive demands of life in a particular time and place.
If we split these forces up and decide on some fixed order of
influence, the cart will be before the horse, whichever order we choose!
<!--Linguistic relativism is wrong, not because language does not affect
thought, but rather, because they organically co-evolve.-->
Linguistic universalism, relativism's opposite number, seems to me to
make the same error of unidirectional generalisation.
A mnemonic is a way of shaping cognition with language, and education
is (in part) the mnemonic of a whole structure of life, a process of
enculturation and cognitive bootstrapping via language.
<!--(Of course, teaching has a strongly social aspect as well, but the -->
<!--point is that the influence is sometimes relatively unilateral, -->
<!--pace universalism.)-->

If linguistic universalism is too strong, there is a
*cognitive universalism* which seems much more defensible (and which,
in fairness, is closer to what most universalists believe).
Human brains don't magically change when we cross cultural or racial
boundaries, and indeed, language and culture can be viewed as *interfaces*
between the IO of reality and our relatively invariant cognitive hardware.
Interfaces differ, since reality differs (sub-Saharan Africa is not
Nunangat), but even given these differences, the choice of interface is radically non-unique.
But if linguistic relativism is a claim that language changes our
brains in any way *other than* the usual
[Hebbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory) fashion, then
it is clearly wrong.
Similarly, if universalism claims that language *cannot* change our
brains in a Hebbian fashion, it is clearly wrong.

#### Cognitive relativism and chauvinism

Cognitive universalism *within* the species seems plausible.
But *between* species we would expect some form of cognitive
relativism.
A dog snuffling around in the undergrowth, or a bat navigating by
sonar, are experiencing the world in a different way; they "see"
things we don't.
As with linguistic relativism, we can distinguish two forms of
cognitive relativism.
The strong form states that *your brain determines your reality*.
The weak replaces "determines" with "influences".
