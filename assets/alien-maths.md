#### Inverting Sapir-Whorf

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
We cut nature up, organize it into
concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are
parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that
holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns
of our language.

<!-- We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The
categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do
not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the
contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions
which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the
linguistic systems of our minds. -->

Language, it seems, is naturally tied to our view of reality.
The inuit have
[many more root words for snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo_words_for_snow)
than exist in English, and according to some linguists,
the
[Hopi language reflects a different conception of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi_time_controversy).
The view that language affects our perception of reality is called
*linguistic relativism*, though the term encompasses a morass of
distinctions in strength and emphasis.

Perhaps the sharpest version of the hypothesis is that
[colour words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate)
reflects cultural differences in the perception of colour.
This ties into the prediliction 19th century Europeans had for
making cognitive judgments on the basis of style.
For instance, the paucity of colour words in the works Homer led British politician
William Gladstone to write that

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
...the organ of color and its impressions were but partially
developed among the Greeks of the heroic age.
</span>

Pomposity and racism aside, there is a scientific thesis
here.
Experiments by cognitive linguists suggest that colour
terminology *does* lead to performance differences in tasks involving
colour memorisation, for example.
