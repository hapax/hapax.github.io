**December 14, 2029.** *Another bathroom-themed post, this time
  on the mysterious billowing of shower curtains during use.*

#### The case of the contrary curtain

A few days ago, I was taking a shower when I noticed the bottom of the
shower curtain nipping at my heels. The bathroom window was closed,
and the house was not particularly drafty, so I began to wonder if
there was another explanation.
Before I left the shower, I had arrived at a hypothesis: the hot water
of the shower is lighter than the cold air outside, so it rises over
the top of the shower curtain, cools, and compresses the cold air
outside.
The pressure difference sucks the cold air in under the curtain.

I mentioned this to my partner, who said she had observed the same
effect in a *cold* shower.
Clearly, my hypothesis was wrong! Some other mechanism is at play.
I did some googling, and discover that this phenomenon, called the
*shower curtain effect*, is actually surprisingly complex and not
fully understood!
Fluid dynamics simulations by UMass professor
[David Schmidt](https://mie.umass.edu/faculty/david-schmidt) suggest
that a horizontal vortex forms.
Like a hurricane, this rotation leads to lower pressure in the middle,
with the centripetal force due to a pressure difference.

#### The CoandÄƒ effect

Schmidt's explanation is appealing exotic.
But it is hard for the ordinary person to test.
More surprisingly, there is another mechanism which seems just as
important
