**August 13, 2020.** *A quick introduction to extreme values.*

#### Extreme values

I recently stumbled onto the
[beautiful lectures](https://ntrl.ntis.gov/NTRL/dashboard/searchResults/titleDetail/PB175818.xhtml)
of [Emil Gumbel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Julius_Gumbel) on
the statistics of extreme values, an area he helped
found along with R. A. Fisher and Leonard Tippett.
Gumbel was not only a mathematician, but also a prominent anti-Nazi
activist. In the 1920s, he documented political murders by the
*Sturmabteilung*, the Nazi paramilitary wing, and was one of the 33
signatories of the
[*Dringender Appell*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urgent_Call_for_Unity),
calling on non-Nazi politicans to unite "in the rejection of fascism",
prior to the 1932 elections.
The politicians did not unite, and the Nazis consolidated their grip
on Weimar politics.
Gumbel was forced to leave his Professorship at Heidelberg shortly
afterwards, and moved to France and then the US, where he taught at
Columbia until his death in 1966.

Gumbel's lectures were given under the auspices of the Applied
Mathematics Division at the National Bureau of Standards.
The extreme values he considers are rather different---though in some
cases, comparably dangerous---to those he was resisting in Weimar
Germany.
