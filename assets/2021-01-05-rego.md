**January 5, 2021.** *Sublets is a fun game for road trips. Take
  letters from the license plates of passing cars, and find words of
  which the license plate letters form a subsequence. I explain the
  game in more detail and provide code for finding solutions.*

#### Introduction

*Sublets* (standing for "subsequence of letters") is a game that, to
the best of my knowledge, my family collectively invented on a car
trip to South Australia in the noughties.
In my home state of Victoria, Australia,
license plates used to be alphanumeric strings consisting of three
letters and three numbers.
The game was simply to find a word those three letters occurred, in
that order.
In mathematical parlance, the license plate letters are a subsequence
of the word.
Here is an example:

$$
\mathbf{SPF} \to \mathbf{SP}\text{oo}\mathbf{F}.
$$

The way we played, first to find a valid word won the round.
If a tie breaker was needed, shorter and/or simpler words were
preferred, so "spoof" beats "soporific".
