**October 21, 2020.** *If you believe the speed-reading hype, you can
  read as fast as you like without sacrificing
  comprehension. Responsible psychological research shows this is not
  the case: there is inevitably a cognitive tradeoff between speed and
  fidelity of processing. I perform some less responsible "research"
  and show that, even for a brain vastly superior to ours, there are
  fundamental physics limits on speed reading.*
