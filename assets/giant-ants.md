If aliens ever visit the earth, might they take the form of giant
ants? Or could radioactive waste create
[*kaiju*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiju) like Godzilla and
Mothra, duking it out in the Japanese sea while the puny humans watch
on in terror?
And might the king of Skull Island one day clamber up the Empire State
to protect Ann Dwarrow?

All of these monsters are essentially normal terrestrial animals,
scaled up to ridiculous sizes.
And it turns out that --- for better or worse, depending on how you
feel about giant ants --- scaling things up to ridiculous sizes is
ridiculous. The ants will just collapse under their own weight,
assuming that they're built out of the same stuff as the little ants.

To see why the ants collapse, we'll need to understand the maths and
physics of *scaling*: how things change with size.
But we're going to do much more than rule out giant ants.
We'll turn our understanding of scaling into a *predictive tool*,
something you can use to learn positive facts about things in the
world, and not simply negative, sort of boring things, like "King Kong
vs. Godzilla is physicaly implausible". I mean, we kind of already
knew that.
