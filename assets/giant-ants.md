If aliens ever visit the earth, might they take the particularly
schlocky form of giant ants? Or could radioactive waste create
[*kaiju*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiju) like Godzilla and
Mothra, duking it out in the Japanese sea while the puny humans watch
on in terror?
And might the king of Skull Island one day clamber up the Empire State
Building, Ann Dwarrow in one hand and a military helicopter in the other?

For better or worse, depending on how you feel about giant ants, the
answer is no.
All of these monsters are essentially normal terrestrial organisms,
scaled up to ridiculous sizes, and when we scale things up to
ridiculous sizes, they tend to collapse under their own weight.

To see why the giant ants or lizards or gorillas collapse under their
own weight, we'll need to understand the maths and physics of
*scaling*, in other words, how things change with size.
But we're going to do much more than simply rule out the existence of
giant ants.
We'll turn our understanding of scaling into a *predictive tool*,
something you can use to learn positive facts about the
world, and not just negative, sort of boring facts, like "King Kong
vs. Godzilla is physically implausible". I mean, we already
knew that.
Instead, we can do cool things like estimate the walking speed of a
spider, or the weight of the largest tree in the world.

But here's the really cool thing. If we want to explain something as
simple as a heartbeat, or the caloric requirements of a monkey, we'll be
led to the startling hypothesis that animals are *fractals*: they are
built out of structures which look the same when you zoom in.
Turns out there are a bunch of interesting design problems involved in
running an organism, and nature evolved fractals in order to solve them.
