<p>
We're going to start our journey towards entanglement with the famous
experiment of Stern and Gerlach. 
From there, we can motivate the basic ideas of quantum
mechanics with a liberal dose of hindsight and handwaving.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Stern-Gerlach and Quantisation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Particles in atoms &#x2014; electrons, protons, and neutrons &#x2014; contain an
<i>intrinsic dipole moment</i> or <i>spin</i>, essentially a little bar magnet
attached to the particle.
This means that &#x2014; independent of their charge &#x2014; these particles are deflected
by changing magnetic fields.
In at atom, spins like to pair up and cancel out, since this is a lower energy state.
Thus, there exist atoms (most importantly silver) which are
electrically neutral, with a <i>single unpaired electron</i> left over;
their response to a magnetic field is effectively determined by a
single electron spin.
</p>

<p>
In the <i>Stern-Gerlach (SG) experiment</i>, we shoot a whole bunch of silver
atoms through a magnetic field, with a photographic plate at the other
end to register the trajectory of the atoms.
Suppose the magnetic field is changing in the \(z\) direction.
If the atoms move through the apparatus quickly enough, the deflection
is simply proportional to \(z\) component of their spin.
We expect the spins to be randomly oriented, since we haven't
done anything to align them, so they should produce a <i>continuous</i>
distribution on our photographic plate.
What actually happens is extremely surprising!
Instead of a continuous distribution, we get <i>two sharp peaks</i> of
equal strength, corresponding to spins in the \(\pm z\) direction:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="https://hapax.github.io/images/Stern-Gerlach.gif" alt="Stern-Gerlach.gif" width="400px" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> The horizontal variance is due to imperfect collimation. \(N\) is the count of atoms at that \(z\) value.</p>
</div>

<p>
This is bizarre.
The peaks can only be explained by supposing that the randomly
oriented spins snap (with equal probability) to the \(\pm z\)
directions when they pass through the field.
There are two more relevant experimental facts.
First, if we apply another SG apparatus to either the up or the down
spins <i>separately</i>, nothing happens: we observe a <i>single</i> peak
corresponding to the spin we selected.
Second, if we <i>rotate</i> the second SG apparatus by \(90 ^\circ\) (say
the field changes in the \(x\) direction), we get the same "spin
snapping" effect, with a new bimodal distribution along the \(x\)-axis.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Our original SG apparatus is designed to measure the component of spin
in the \(z\) direction.
Classically, if there is no \(z\) component, there is no deflection.
We find, however, that the outcome of this measurement is <i>quantised</i>:
we can only get <i>spin up</i> or <i>spin down</i> in the direction of the field.
Making sense of this experiment required the
greatest revolution in scientific thought since Isaac Newton.
Rather than recapitulate this convoluted history, we're going to skip
ahead to the answer and check that it works.
However, see <a href="#sec-1-4">1.4</a> for more on the history of
quantum mechanics.
</p>

<p>
For simplicity, we focus on the unpaired electron in the silver
atom.
In the SG experiment, only the spin up and spin down states show up.
Thus, we hypothesise that the spin of the electron is not a spatial
vector with some fixed orientation, but instead a <i>linear combination</i>
(a sum with coefficients) of the two states that matter, spin up and
spin down.
We denote vectors as labels surrounded by funny brackets,
"\(|\text{label}\rangle\)".
Using this notation, we call the spin state \(|\psi\rangle\), and the
special spin up and spin down states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) respectively.
Our hypothesis means we can write \(|\psi\rangle\) explicitly as a
combination of spin states, or implicitly as a column vector:
\[ |\psi\rangle =    
   \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle \equiv \left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha \\ \beta \end{array}\right].
\]
It turns out that we need to make \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) <i>complex
numbers</i>; I will explain why <a href="#sec-1-4">below</a>.
Let's call the two-dimensional vector space of these linear combinations
\(V_2\).
</p>

<p>
What does a measurement do to these vectors?
First of all, measurements produce numbers.
In the case of the SG apparatus, we can think of it as giving \(\pm 1\)
depending on whether it sees a spin up (\(+1\)) or a spin down (\(-1\)).
And, if \(|\psi\rangle\) happens to equal spin up or spin down, it leaves it
alone, as the second SG apparatus shows.
There is a nice way to integrate these different facts, but before we
do that, let me remind you of some linear algebra.
A <i>linear transformation</i> on \(V\) is a function \(A: V \to V\) with the
property that
\[
A(\alpha|\psi\rangle + \beta|\phi\rangle) =
\alpha A|\psi\rangle + \beta A|\phi\rangle
\]
for any vectors \(|\psi\rangle, |\phi\rangle \in V\) and complex
numbers \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}\).
Equivalently, we can write \(A\) as a matrix
\[
A = \left[\begin{array}{cc}A_{00}&A_{10}\\A_{01}&A_{11}\end{array}\right],
\]
and figure out \(A|\psi\rangle\) using matrix multiplication.
It is also helpful to note that the columns of \(A\) are just the image
of the basis vectors \(|0\rangle, |1\rangle\),
\[
A|0\rangle = \left[\begin{array}{c} A_{00} \\ A_{01}
\end{array}\right], \quad A|1\rangle = \left[\begin{array}{c} A_{10} \\ A_{11}
\end{array}\right].
\]
Finally, an <i>eigenvector</i> \(|\lambda\rangle\) of \(A\) is a vector which
\(A\) streteches by a factor \(\lambda\), the corresponding <i>eigenvalue</i>:
\[
A|\lambda\rangle = \lambda|\lambda\rangle.
\]
We illustrate this below:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="https://hapax.github.io/images/eigen.png" alt="eigen.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Phew! With all that linear algebra out of the way, we can finally
outline the <i>quantum mechanical</i> version of what's happening in the SG
experiment.
Having hypothesised that spin states are vectors in \(V_2\), we now
suppose that the SG apparatus acts as a linear operator on \(V_2\).
We'll call this operator \(Z\), since we measure the spin in the \(z\)-direction.
Furthermore, we suppose that the eigenvectors of \(Z\) are the spin up
and spin down states, with eigenvalues respectively \(\pm 1\).
This immediately implies that \(Z\) is given by
\[
Z = \left[\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\0&-1\end{array}\right].
\]
Let's restate our conclusions once more:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Measurement corresponds to a linear operator acting on a vector space
*of states \(V\).</b>
<b>Eigenvectors of the operator return their eigenvalues as measurement
results.</b>
<b>If the spin state is an eigenvector, it does not change after measurement.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is all well and good, but what about states that are not
eigenvectors?
We'll consider this in the next section.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Exercise 1.1.</b> Confirm that \(Z\) has the eigenproperties \(Z|0\rangle =
  1\), \(Z|1\rangle = -1\).
</li>
<li><b>Exercise 1.2.</b> Consider the matrices
\[
  X = \left[\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\1&0\end{array}\right], \quad Y =
  \left[\begin{array}{cc}0&-i\\i&0\end{array}\right].
  \]
Find the eigenctors and eigenvalues.
(As the notation suggests, \(X\) and \(Y\) correspond to measuring the
spin in the \(x\)- and \(y\)-direction, so you can anticipate eigenvalues \(\pm 1\).)

<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Intrinsic Randomness</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
We have yet to explain why randomly oriented spin states "snap" into
the special spin up and spin down states.
At this point, the weirdness of quantum mechanics truly rears its
head.
Suppose we have a spin state<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
\[|\psi\rangle = \left[\begin{array}{c}
\alpha \\ \beta \end{array}\right], \quad |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 > 0.
\]
To explain the mechanics of "snapping", we make a bold hypothesis:
our state \(|\psi\rangle\) snaps to the spin up or spin down state
<i>randomly</i>, with probabilities given by
</p>

\begin{align*}
p_0 & \equiv p(|0\rangle \text{ after measurement}) =
\frac{|\alpha|^2}{|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2} \\
 p_1 & \equiv p(|1\rangle \text{
after measurement}) = \frac{|\beta|^2}{|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2}.
\end{align*}

<p>
For a random distribution of coefficients \(\alpha, \beta\), from
symmetry we would expect that half the time the spins snap to spin up,
and half the time they snap to spin down.<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Classical physics is a set of deterministic, clockwork theories.
Even in situations which necessitate the use of probability
(e.g. thermodynamics), we are modelling our ignorance, and assume
that at a basic level, physical objects are still behaving in a definite way.
Quantum mechanics is such a huge conceptual shift because it posits <i>basic,
unavoidable randomness</i> in nature.
</p>

<p>
As a quick sanity check, we see that \(p_0 + p_1 = 1\).
We also note that <i>rescaling</i> \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) by a common factor
so that the numerator of these expressions equals \(1\) does not change
the probabilities.
(Equivalently, we are just rescaling the whole vector.)
It turns out<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> this rescaling doesn't affect anything else, so from now
on we assume
\[ |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.
\]
There is a more elegant way to extract the probabilities \(p_0, p_1\)
using an <i>inner product</i>.
First, we denote the <i>complex conjugate</i> of a complex number \(\alpha\)
by \(\alpha^*\), and the <i>Hermitian conjugate</i> of a complex matrix \(A = [A_{ij}]\) by
\[
A^\dagger = [A_{ij}]^\dagger = [A^*_{ji}].
\]
In other words, we swap rows and columns and complex conjugate all the
entries. 
The inner product of two complex vectors is
\[\left[\begin{array}{c} \alpha_1 \\ \beta_1 \end{array}\right] \cdot
\left[\begin{array}{c} \alpha_2 \\ \beta_2 \end{array}\right] =
\left[\begin{array}{c} \alpha_1 \\ \beta_1 \end{array}\right]^\dagger
\left[\begin{array}{c} \alpha_2 \\ \beta_2 \end{array}\right] = 
\left[\begin{array}{cc} \alpha_1^* & \beta_1^* \end{array}\right]
\left[\begin{array}{c} \alpha_2 \\ \beta_2 \end{array}\right] = 
\alpha_1^*\alpha_2 + \beta_1^*\beta_2.
\]
More abstractly, if \(|\psi\rangle\) is a vector, we denote
\(|\psi\rangle^\dagger = \langle \psi|\), and \(|\psi\rangle
\cdot |\phi\rangle = \langle \psi |\phi\rangle\).
We also note that our inner product is "conjugate symmetric" and linear
in the second argument:
\[
\langle \psi | \phi\rangle = \langle \phi | \psi\rangle^*, \quad
\langle \psi| (\alpha|\phi\rangle + \beta|\xi\rangle) = \alpha\langle \psi |\phi\rangle + \beta\langle \psi|\xi\rangle.
\]
It also follows from our normalisation of coefficients that every
vector has unit inner product with itself:
\[ |\psi|^2 \equiv
\langle\psi  |\psi\rangle = |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.
\]
We call \(|\psi|\) the <i>norm</i> of the vector, so every state has unit norm.
Finally, here is our elegant expression for the probabilities:
\[
p_n = |\langle \psi | n \rangle|^2, \quad n = 0, 1.
\]
The complex numbers \(\alpha = \langle \psi | 0 \rangle\), \(\beta =
\langle \psi | 1 \rangle\) are called <i>amplitudes</i>.
If the spin snapped to state \(|n\rangle\), the
measurement yielded the corresponding eigenvalue \((-1)^n\).
This leads to another quantum mechanical dictum:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>After measuring a state \(|\psi\rangle\), it snaps to eigenvector
 \(|n\rangle\) of the measurement operator with probability \(|\langle\psi|n\rangle|^2\), and yields the corresponding eigenvalue \(\lambda_n\).</b>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What I've called "snapping" is more conventionally (and melodramatically)
called "collapse".
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Exercise 1.3.</b> Show that \(|0\rangle\) (spin up in the \(z\)-direction)
snaps with probability \(1/2\) to spin up or spin down in the
\(x\)-direction.
This explains why applying a second SG apparatus to the spin up
particles, oriented in the \(x\)-direction, produces a new bimodal
pattern.
</li>
<li><b>Exercise 1.4.</b> Prove that the inner product is conjugate symmetric
and linear in the second argument.

<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> The Schrödinger equation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
We still have a few loose ends to tie up before we move on to entanglement.
First of all, why do we use complex numbers?
Couldn't we forget about amplitudes altogether, and just use
probabilities?
And even if we do use amplitudes, why do they have to be complex?
The short answer is the <i>Schrödinger equation</i>.
If \(H\) is the operator measuring energy, then an arbitrary state
\(|\psi\rangle\) evolves in time according to the differential equation<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup>
\[
i \frac{\partial |\psi\rangle}{\partial t} = H |\psi\rangle.
\]
This has nothing to do with measurement or collapse; this describes
evolution <i>between</i> measurements.
The appearance of \(i = \sqrt{-1}\) is a sign that quantum mechanics
must involve complex numbers.
Even if we start off with <i>real</i> linear combinations of vectors, the
evolution turns them into <i>complex</i> linear combinations!
I'll conclude the section with a few optional snippets.

<h4 id="sec-1-4-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.4.1</span> *Making Light of the Schrödinger equation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4-1">
<p>
Light can be thought of a sinusoidal wiggle moving through space at
\(c = 3\times 10^8\) m/s.
The top of wiggle is called a <i>crest</i>.
The <i>frequency</i> of the wave is the number of crests passing a given
spot per second, while the <i>wavelength</i> is the distance between adjacent
crests.
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="https://hapax.github.io/images/wave-freq.jpg" alt="wave-freq.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In 1905, Einstein explained the photoelectric effect<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> by positing
that light is made of <i>quanta</i>, discrete packets of energy.
The lump of energy in each quantum is related to the frequency by
\[
E = 2\pi f \equiv \omega,
\]
where \(\omega\) is the <i>angular frequency</i>.
It's not hard to show that the speed of the wave is the product of
wavelength and frequency, so
\[
c = f\lambda \equiv \frac{\omega}{k}, \quad k \equiv \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}.
\]
A simple equation for a sinusoidal wiggle is
\[
g(x, t) \equiv \cos\left(kx - \omega t\right).
\]
As you can check, this satisfies a <i>wave equation</i>
\[
\frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial x^2} =
\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 g}{\partial t^2}.
\]
However, if you shift the cosine term you get a sine term.
Multiply it
by \(i\), add them together, and use Euler's formula:
\[
h(x, t) \equiv \cos\left(kx - \omega t\right) + i \sin\left(kx - \omega t\right) =
e^{i(kx - \omega t)}.
\]
Since this is just a sum of waves moving at speed \(c\), it certainly
obeys the wave equation, but in fact, it satisfies an even simpler equation:
\[
i\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = \omega h = Eh,
\]
remembering Einstein's identification \(E = \omega\).
This is pretty much the Schrödinger equation.
Schrödinger first wrote down the equation while on vacation in the
Swiss Alps in 1925.
The big step was to apply this to <i>everything</i> and not just light. 
Schrödinger was convinced that everything should satisfy a wave
equation by the work of de Broglie on matter waves in 1924.

It just so happens that for our spin observable \(Z\), there are two
eigenvectors with real eigenvalues.
If we had a matrix with fewer eigenvectors, we can run into a serious
problem: the transition probabilities don't add up to 1!
Another problem is that eigenvalues (allowed measurement outcomes)
could be <i>imaginary</i>.
If you ask how big something is, and you get the answer "\(i\)",
something has probably gone wrong.

We can solve these problems in one fell swoop by insisting that
measurements correspond to operators which equal their own Hermitian
conjugate. More simply, these are called <i>Hermitian operators</i>:
\[
A^\dagger = A \quad \text{ or equivalently } \quad A_{ij}^* = A_{ji}.
\]
Why? First of all, this guarantees that the eigenvectors are real.
Suppose that \(A|\lambda\rangle = \lambda|\lambda\rangle\).
Then, since \(\langle \lambda |\lambda\rangle = 1\),
\[
\lambda = \langle \lambda |
(\lambda|\lambda\rangle) = \langle \lambda | (A |\lambda\rangle)
=  |\lambda\rangle^\dagger A |\lambda\rangle = |\lambda\rangle^\dagger
A^\dagger |\lambda\rangle =
(A|\lambda\rangle)^\dagger |\lambda\rangle = \lambda^*.
\]
This means \(\lambda = \lambda^*\), so \(\lambda\) is a real number.
A second reason for restricting to Hermitian operators is a powerful
mathematical result called the <i>spectral theorem</i>.
This guarantees that, for any Hermitian matrix \(A\), the
eigenvectors of \(A\) form an <i>orthonormal basis</i> for the space \(V\):
\[
A|n\rangle = \lambda_n |n\rangle, \quad \langle m | n\rangle =
\delta_{mn}, \quad \text{span}(|1\rangle, \ldots, |d\rangle) = V.
\]
This can be extended with a little care to infinite-dimensional spaces
(needed for standard treatments of quantum mechanics), but we will
deal exclusively with <i>finite-dimensional</i> spaces in these notes.
</p>

<p>
It is an axiom of quantum mechanics that any genuine measurement we
can make corresponds to some Hermitian operator. Conversely, any
Hermitian operator should correspond to some measurement. However,
experimentally <i>realising</i> operators can be an extremely tricky
business, a point we will return to later.

Recall that we started with a vector space \(V_2\), consisting of all
linear combinations of the form
\[\alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle, \quad \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}.
\]
Thus, to begin with we have two completely unconstrained complex
parameters, or \(2\times 2 = 4\) real parameters,
since each complex number encodes two real numbers, \(\alpha =
\alpha_1 + i\alpha_2\).
We then argued that we could rescale physical states (other than the
zero vector), which represents a single complex constraint, or two
real constraints.
Alternatively, we fix \(|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2 = 1\) and identify unit
norm states which differ only by a phase \(e^{i\theta}\).
Either way, we only have <i>two real parameters</i>.
</p>

<p>
What does the overall space look like?
There is a nice way to visualise it which also has applications in quantum computing.
Since \(|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1\), we can identify
\[ |\alpha| = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad |\beta| =
\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \quad 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi,
\]
where we restrict \(0 \leq \theta \leq \pi\) so that both sine and cosine
are positive.
We can always multiply by a total phase factor so that \(\alpha\) is
real, and \(\beta = e^{i\phi}|\beta|\) for \(0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi\).
We also note that \(\phi\) is <i>periodic</i>, since \(e^{2\pi i} = e^0 = 1\).
Assembling these two facts, we see that the space of spin states looks
like a sphere, called the <i>Bloch sphere</i>:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="https://hapax.github.io/images/bloch.png" alt="bloch.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Just to be explicit, the map from the Bloch spherical coordinates \((\theta,
\phi)\) to spin states is given by
\[|\psi(\theta, \phi)\rangle =
\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|0\rangle +
e^{i\phi}\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|1\rangle = 
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\cos\left(\theta/2\right) \\ e^{i\phi}\sin\left(\theta/2\right) \end{array}\right].

So far, we have been discussing the spin of a <i>single</i> electron;
according to quantum mechanics, this must be modelled as a state
living in a vector space \(V_2\).
Entanglement is a relation between systems, so we have to figure out
what happens when we put two systems together.

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Glomming Quantum Systems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
In general, quantum mechanical systems are vector spaces.
Thus, we need to think about how to join two vector spaces \(U, V\)
together to form a new vector space \(W\).
One way to approach is to constrain the joining of systems at the
level of a <i>joining operation</i> \(\otimes : U \times V \to W\), which takes
individual vectors in \(U\) and \(V\) and returns a vector in \(W\):
\[ |u\rangle \in U, |v\rangle \in V \mapsto |u\rangle \otimes |v\rangle
\in W.
\]
What properties should this joining operation have?
Most importantly, we want glomming to respect the structure of each vector space.
This means switching back and forth between the combined systems and
the individual systems won't mess up the algebra.
Put another way, if the second system is in some fixed state
\(|v\rangle\) (it could be an unconnected spin on the other side of the
universe), we need to be able to manipulate the first system
independently.
Mathematically,
\[(\alpha|u_1\rangle + \beta |u_2\rangle)\otimes |v\rangle
= \alpha|u_1\rangle\otimes |v\rangle + \beta |u_2\rangle\otimes |v\rangle,
\] 
with a similar relationship for linear combinations in the second
argument.
We call such an operation <i>bilinear</i>.
</p>

<p>
Our second requirement is that \(W\) contain copies of \(U\) and \(V\).
For instance, fixing \(|v\rangle \in V\) and using linearity in the
first argument, we get
\[
\left(\sum_{k=1}^{\text{dim}
U}\alpha_k|u_k\rangle\right)\otimes |v\rangle =
\sum_{k=1}^{\text{dim}
U}\alpha_k|u_k\rangle\otimes |v\rangle \in W,
\]
where \(|u_k\rangle\) is a basis of \(V\).
As long as the \(|u_k\rangle \otimes |v\rangle\) are linearly independent
(no linear combination of them vanishes), this embeds a copy of \(U\)
in \(W\).
</p>

<p>
A minimal way to ensure this is to <i>define</i> \(W\) as a new space with
basis vectors
\[|w_{ij}\rangle \equiv |u_i\rangle \otimes |v_j\rangle, \quad 1 \leq
i \leq \text{dim} U, \quad 1 \leq j \leq \text{dim} V,
\]
where in addition, \(\otimes\) is bilinear.
This is called the <i>tensor product</i>, since bilinearity looks very much
like the distributivity property of the humdrum product of scalars.
In other words, the glommed system \(W\) has dimenion \(\text{dim} U
\cdot \text{dim}V\).
You can check this ensures the independence condition above.
The operation \(\otimes\) applies to individual vectors, but also tells
us how to glom the systes \(U\) and \(V\), so we can write \(W = U \otimes
V\).
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Exercise 2.1.</b> Show that \(\otimes\) as defined above embeds copies

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.1</span> *Direct sums</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
If you have some linear algebra, you might wonder why we don't
use the <i>direct sum</i> \(\oplus\) instead.
This obeys the rule
\[
(\alpha_1|u_1\rangle + \alpha_2|u_2\rangle) \oplus
(\beta_1|v_1\rangle + \beta_2|v_2\rangle) = (\alpha_1 |u_1\rangle
\oplus \beta_1 |v_1\rangle) + (\alpha_2 |u_2\rangle \oplus
\beta_2 |v_2\rangle).
\]
(Equivalently, we can put \(|u\rangle\) and \(|v\rangle\) into a big
column vector \([|u\rangle, |v\rangle]^T\) and add in the usual way.)
This is the wrong rule for glomming systems, since we cannot generally
fix the state of, say, the second system and do linear algebra in the first.
In fact, the direct sum is only linear in one argument when the fixed
argument is the zero vector! As we discovered earlier, this is not
even a physical state.
</p>

<p>
Another way of seeing the problem is to look at basis vectors, which
encode the basic physical states of the system (e.g spin up and spin
down for \(V_2\)).
For the direct sum \(U \oplus V\), we can cobble together a basis from
the bases of \(U\) and \(V\):
\[
\{|u_1\rangle, \ldots, |u_{\text{dim }U}, |v_1\rangle,
\ldots, |v_{\text{dim }V}\}.
\]
Thus, glomming with \(\oplus\) implies that the basic states of the
combined system are the states of \(U\) or the states of \(V\).
In particular, the <i>combined</i> system could be in some basic physical
state of \(U\) (e.g spin up for \(U = V_2\)) but have <i>no</i> information
about the second system.
This makes no sense!
We have to specify what's going on in both systems, which is precisely
what the basis of the tensor product
\(\{|u_i\rangle\otimes|v_j\rangle\}\) captures.

Now we know how to put quantum systems together, let's consider the
simplest composite system: <i>two</i> electron spins, \(V_2^2 \equiv V_2\otimes V_2\).
This has basis vectors
\[|0\rangle\otimes |0\rangle \equiv |00\rangle,
\quad |0\rangle\otimes |1\rangle \equiv |01\rangle,
\quad |1\rangle\otimes |0\rangle \equiv |10\rangle,
\quad |1\rangle\otimes |0\rangle \equiv |11\rangle.
\]
Our basis vectors are nicely labelled by a string of two binary
digits, or a binary \(2\)-string.
(We can do the same trick for \(n\) glommed copies of \(V_2\), yielding a
vector space \(V_{2}^n\) with basis vectors labelled by the \(2^n\) binary
\(n\)-strings.)
</p>

<p>
Now, since \(V_2^2\) is a vector space, the physical "two-spin" states are
just any normalised vectors,
\[|\psi\rangle=
\sum_{i,j=0}^1 \alpha_{ij}  |ij\rangle = \alpha_{00}|00\rangle+\alpha_{01}|01\rangle+\alpha_{10}|10\rangle+\alpha_{11}|11\rangle, \quad
\sum_{i,j=0}^1 |\alpha_{ij}|^2 = 1.
\]
A two-spin state \(|\psi\rangle\) can be related to single spin states in two ways:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it is a tensor product of two single spin states, \(|\psi\rangle
  = |u\rangle \times |v\rangle\);
</li>
<li>it is <i>not</i> a tensor product of single spin states.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first are called <i>separable</i> states, while the second type are
called <i>entangled</i>.
</p>

<p>
We end this subsection with some examples.
Any of the basis states are separable, e.g. \(|01\rangle\).
However, there are more interesting separable states like
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+|1\rangle)\otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
(|0\rangle+|1\rangle) =
\frac{1}{2}(|00\rangle + |01\rangle + |10\rangle + |11\rangle).
\]
For entangled states, how do we check that <i>no</i> tensor product of
single spin states works?
Well, consider an <i>arbitrary</i> separable state,
\[
(\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle)\otimes (\gamma|0\rangle + \delta
\alpha|1\rangle) = \alpha\gamma|00\rangle + \alpha\delta|01\rangle +
\beta\gamma|10\rangle + \beta\delta|11\rangle.
\]
Let's label the coefficients using \(\alpha_{ij}\) as above.
Apart from the usual normalisation \(|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2
= |\gamma|^2 + |\delta|^2 = 1\), we can see the coefficients are
related by
\[
\alpha_{00}\alpha_{11} = \alpha_{01}\alpha_{10} =
\alpha\beta\gamma\delta.
\]
Turning it round, if this condition holds, we can always find \(\alpha,
\beta, \gamma, \delta\) satisfying the constraints, and the state is
separable.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
So, if Alice and Bob share an EPR pair, and they measure their
 qubits in any order, when they later compares notes they find they
 always measure opposite states. The qubits knows about each other
 <i>instantaneously</i> &#x2014; even though Bob and Alice are on opposite
 sides of the galaxy. Einstein and co called this "spooky action at
 a distance", and concluded that quantum mechanics couldn't be the
 whole story.
</p>

<p>
Experimentally speaking, we now know that entanglement is a real
thing, but let's see what freaked Einstein out.
For EPR, the deal-breaker was the violation of a fundamental physical
principle called <i>locality</i>: roughly, the idea that you can only
physically influence nearby things.
There's a very strong reason to love, honour and obey locality,
connected to special relativity. If we can transmit information faster
than the speed of light, then you can easily build a time machine
which sends information <i>backwards in time</i> (illustrated below). All you need to do is
arrange the receivers to be moving relative to each other. This gives
rise to all the paradoxes of time travel.
</p>

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5:</span> Two observers, \(O_1\) and \(O_2\), build a time machine by transmitting signals instantaneously (in their reference frames). Signal 1 is instantaneous in the frame of O<sub>1</sub>, while signal 2 is instaneous in the frame of O<sub>2</sub>. This means O<sub>1</sub> receives the signal in the past!</p>
</div>

<p>
But since entanglement is a non-local, <i>instantaneous</i> connection
  between Alice and Bob's qubits, it seems they can make a time 
  machine! All Alice needs to do is jerry-rig the system so her qubit
  goes into particular states. Bob then measures his system, flips the
  bits, and has a message encoded in binary.
</p>

<p>
Luckily for the space-time continuum, Alice <i>can't</i> jerry-rig the
  system this way. Quantum mechanics got us into this mess, and it
  saves us; although it permits entanglement, it prevents Alice from
  shoehorning a qubit into a desired state. The outcome of her
  measurements is always random, always out of her control. Bob may
  learn that outcome instantaneously, but because it can't be
  controlled, it can't be used to transmit information.
 The moral of the story is that entanglement really is spooky and
  non-local. But it respects a weaker property called <i>causality</i>: no
  faster than light messaging, and hence, no time machines.

But although we can't use entanglement to send information, Alice
 and Bob <i>share</i> a resource &#x2014; the value of the measurement &#x2014;
 without having to communicate about it classically. This shared
 resource can be used for <i>quantum key distribution</i> (QKD).
The goal for Alice and Bob is to share a string of random bits, over
 an unsecure channel, and check that it hasn't been snooped on. They
 can then use the random string as a parameter for encrypting
 subsequent messages. It doesn't matter that the key is random &#x2014;
 all that matters is that they share the key and nobody else does.
Let's call the adversary Eve. Her goal is to figure out Alice and
 Bob's shared key without them realising. Otherwise, even if Eve knows
 the key, they won't use it!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Let's start with a simple scheme that <i>doesn't</i> work. We suppose
that Alice and Bob have an infinite source of EPR pairs, which sends
one qubit to Alice, and another to Bob. They can generate as many of
these pairs as they like.
Alice and Bob make measurements on each pair as it comes in. Since
the qubits are entangled, they will get <i>opposite</i> results. They can
generate a string of bits &#x2014; as long as they like &#x2014; by simply
making Alice's measurements the shared string. All Bob needs to do
is flip his bits to obtain precisely the same bit string as Alice.
</p>

<p>
 The problem is that there is no way for them to guard against
 Eve. For instance, suppose Eve measures Alice's qubit en route. If
 Eve observes a \(|0\rangle\), the EPR pair becomes a product state:
 \[|\text{EPR}\rangle  \to |0\rangle|1\rangle.
  \]
 Now Alice will measure \(0\), and Bob will measure \(1\). They will
 still be able to construct a shared bit string, but Eve will know it
 as well.
Note that Eve's measurement <i>destroys</i> the entanglement between
 Alice and Bob's qubit. This gives us a clue about how to detect
 interference: we need a scheme where the loss of entanglement,
 before the qubits arrive at Alice and Bob, leaves a signature.

<h3 id="sec-3-3"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Rotating bits</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
It turns out that we can detect interference by choosing to rotate
 our measuring device every now and again. This is called the <i>BB84</i>
 protocol, created by Bennett and Brassard in 1984 (as the name
 rather unimaginatively suggests).
With a cat in a box, ``rotating the measuring device'' doesn't really
 make sense, at least classically. But a much more practical way to
 implement a qubit is by polarising light; in this case, rotating the
 polariser gives rise to a new set of rotated polarisation outcomes.
</p>

<p>
To describe these, let's briefly revisit the single qubit
 situation. We can visualise \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) as \(x\) and
 \(y\) axes on the Cartesian plane.
 Rotating the axes by \(45^\circ\) cw, we get the <i>rotated basis</i>,
 with states
 \[|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle).
  \]
 For polarised light, we just rotate the measuring device by
 \(45^\circ\) cw, and these new states become the associated
 measurement outcomes.

<p>
Before we proceed, let's quickly note a neat algebraic fact about
 the EPR pair. In the \(+-\) basis, it looks pretty much the same as
 the \(01\) basis, as a little algebra shows:
 \[|\text{EPR}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle|1\rangle+|1\rangle|0\rangle)=

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">
<p>
Here is the new protocol. Alice and Bob can still pull EPR pairs
 from a common source, but now they <i>randomly choose</i> whether to
 measure normally (with outcomes \(0\) and \(1\)) or rotate their devices
 (with outcomes \(+\) and \(-\)).
After measuring, they get on their intergalactic smartphones (or
 some other unsecure classical channel) and tell each other what
 basis they used, i.e. \(01\) or \(+-\). If they used the same basis,
 they will have <i>opposite outcomes</i>, from the properties of the EPR
 pair. In this case, they can figure out a shared bit and add it to
 their shared bit string.
</p>

<p>
 If they choose different bases, they have to scrub the qubit, since
 neither can be sure what the other measured. For instance, if Alice
 uses the \(01\) basis and measures \(0\), the state becomes
 \[|0\rangle|1\rangle =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|0\rangle(|+\rangle - |-\rangle).
  \]
 If Bob measures in the \(+-\) basis, he has a \(50\)-\(50\) chance of
 observing either outcome, and Alice has no idea what he measures! By
 the same token, Bob can't tell what Alice measured.
The stage of the protocol &#x2014; where they check basis and scrub some
 qubits &#x2014; is called the <i>sifting phase</i>.

</div>

<p>
 So far, this just seems like a more complicated version of the
 failed scheme from before. But unlike our earlier protocol, we now have the
 wherewithal to detect tampering. For argument's sake, I'm going to
 assume that Alice and Bob flip a (classical) coin to determine which
 basis to measure their qubits in.
To beat Eve, all they need to do is choose a subset of their shared bit string &#x2014;
 remembering that for these bits to go into the shared string in the
 first place, Alice and Bob must have measured them in the
 same basis &#x2014; and over the classical channel, reveal the actual
 measurement outcomes. If they happen to measure the <i>same</i> value,
 instead of the complementary values dictated by entanglement, Alice
 and Bob can tell that someone has been listening in.
</p>

<p>
Let's see why. If Eve intercepts and measures a qubit (which Alice
 and Bob later measure in the same basis), she has to make a choice
 about which basis to measure in: \(01\) or \(+-\). She has a \(50\%\)
 chance of making the same choice as Alice and Bob. If Eve makes the
 same choice as Alice and Bob later make, then as in the single basis
 protocol, her interference with that qubit goes undetected. Alice
 and Bob get complementary outcomes, and no alarm bells go off.
</p>

<p>
But suppose she makes a different choice, for instance, she chooses
 to measure in \(01\) while Alice and Bob measure with \(+-\).
 If Eve intercepts Alice's qubit and measures a \(0\), we get
 \[|\text{EPR}\rangle \to |0\rangle|1\rangle
  = \frac{1}{2}(|+\rangle|+\rangle + |+\rangle|-\rangle - |-\rangle|+\rangle - |-\rangle|-\rangle).
  \]
 In other words, Eve's measurement turns the state into a uniform probability
 distribution over all measurement outcomes in the \(+-\) basis. That
 means there is a \(50\%\) chance Alice and Bob choose different
 outcomes (no alarm bells), and a \(50\%\) chance they choose the same
 outcome (alarm bells).
Since Eve has a \(50\%\) chance of choosing a different basis from
 Alice and Bob, and when she does, they still have a \(50\%\) chance of
 getting opposite outcomes, Eve has a \(1/4\) chance of being
 detected, and hence a \(3/4\) chance of going scot free.
</p>

<p>
You may think they are pretty good odds for an eavesdropper. But all
 Alice and Bob need to do, to guarantee an arbitrarily high chance of
 detecting eavesdropping, is to sacrifice enough qubits from the shared
 string. For instance, if they sacrifice \(15\) qubits, Eve has \(1\%\)
 chance of going undetected. If they sacrifice \(100\) qubits, Eve
 chances drop to \(1\) in three trillion. That's the BB84 protocol!
</p>

<p>
You can play around with a BB84 simulator online at <a href="https://www.qkdsimulator.com/">QKD
 Simulator</a>. If you do, you'll see that there is much more to a
 practical QKD implementation than the bare bones outlines I've
 given. For instance, Alice and Bob can correct errors arising from
 noise in the EPR source, and importantly, distinguish these from an
 eavesdropper.

The reason I chose to talk about QKD today is that, although quantum
 computers use entanglement in a much deeper and more interesting
 way, key distribution is the most mature entanglement-based
 technology. EPR pairs are typically implemented as photon
 polarisations sent over optical fibres. The current state of the art
 is quite impressive. Recently, Chinese scientists broke the record
 for distance of entanglement transmission, sending halves of an EPR
 pair between grounds stations over 1200 km apart via a
 satellite. Transmission rates get as high as \(\sim 1\) Mbit/s. At
 that rate, Alice and Bob could encode a copy of <i>War and Peace</i> with
 a one-time pad, which is provably unbreakable, in under a minute. In
 the near future, I think we should expect to see satellite-based QKD
 become available to consumers. It's an exciting time for quantum science!

We impose the condition \(|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 > 0\) since
otherwise we get \(\alpha = \beta = 0\), i.e. the zero vector. This does
not represent a physical state since it has zero length, and as we
will see shortly, physical states have unit length.

The only other point we need to worry about the numbers is the
Schrödinger equation. Consulting [[The Schrödinger equation], you can see
that rescaling \(|\psi\rangle\) by a nonzero complex number does not
change the dynamics.

Get a length of wire, connect one end to a battery and another
to a lump of metal. Shine high-frequency light on the
metal, and a current begins to flow from the lump to the battery.
This suggests that electrons have liberated from the metal lattice by
absorbing energy from the light.
There are two important points: (a) there is a minimum <i>frequency</i>, but
not <i>amplitude</i>, the light must have in order for this to 
happen; (b) increasing the amplitude for a fixed frequency liberates
more electrons but does not speed them up.
From these facts (and previous ideas of Planck), Einstein concluded
that the energy in the light waves was not continuously distributed,
but concentrated into discrete lumps of energy called <i>photons</i>.
From the experimental data, he also argued that the size of the lumps
was proportional to the frequency of light.
