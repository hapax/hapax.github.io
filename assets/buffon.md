**December 23, 2020.** *Buffon asked how likely it is that a randomly
  thrown needle will cross a line on ruled paper. Barbier's elementary
  solution is well-known, but less well-known is the elementary
  extension to noodles, and a simple consequence for funny shaped
  wheels or "woodles".*

#### Buffon's needle

Suppose we throw a needle of length $\ell$ onto an infinitely large
page, with lines ruled horizontally with separation $D$.
If the needle is short, with $\ell < D$, it can intersect at most one
line.
How likely is this?
Following
[Joseph-Ã‰mile Barbier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-%C3%89mile_Barbier),
we can split the randomness into two parts: the vertical position $y$ of the
needle's lower end, and it's angle to the horizontal, $\theta$.

	</div>
	</figure>

We therefore take $y \in [0, D)$, and $\theta \in [0, \pi)$.
To see what the probability of hitting a line is, we note that the lower end of the needle will reach the upper line provided

$$
y \leq \ell \sin \theta.
$$

It's easy to see that, assuming the parameters $(\theta, y)$ for the random throw take a uniform distribution in the rectangle below, the probability is just the area of the region
below the line $y \leq \ell \sin \theta$, divided by the total area of the rectangle, $\pi D$.

    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/buffon2.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

The area $A$ below the line (green) can be calculated using calculus:

$$
\int_0^{\pi} \ell \sin \theta \, \text{d}\theta = \left[-\ell \cos\theta\right]^\pi_0
= \ell (\cos 0 - \cos \pi) = 2\ell.
$$

There is another very simple way to see this without using calculus.
Suppose you swing a slingshot around so that it executes a full revolution
every $2\pi$ seconds.
If the circle has radius $\ell$, the velocity (calculated by consider
a full revolution) is

$$
v = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{2\pi \ell}{2\pi} = \ell.
$$

The velocity has two sinusoidally varying components: a horizontal
component, $v_x = \ell \sin \theta$ and a vertical component $v_y =
\ell \cos \theta$.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/buffon3.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

The horizontal velocity is exactly the curve of interest. The region
underneath the curve is the total *horizontal* distance covered in
half a revolution, since we are adding contributions of the form

$$
v_x \, \Delta \theta \approx \Delta x.
$$

But the total horizontal distance is obviously twice the radius, or
$2\ell$. So no need for calculus!
However we get there, the probability that the short needle of
intersecting a line is

$$
P = \frac{2\ell}{\pi D}.
$$

#### Long needles and noodles

The above reasoning only works for short needles, with $\ell < D$.
Otherwise, the green curve will exceed the grey rectangle, and we have
"cut off" the corresponding area.
This involves a similar integral, but the answer is ugly.
