**December 23, 2020.** *Buffon asked how likely it is that a randomly
  thrown needle will cross a line on ruled paper. Barbier's elementary
  solution is well-known, but less well-known is the elementary
  extension to noodles, random noodles, and a simple consequence for funny shaped
  wheels or "woodles".*

#### Buffon's needle

Suppose we throw a needle of length $\ell$ onto an infinitely large
page, with lines ruled horizontally with separation $D$.
If the needle is short, with $\ell < D$, it can cross at most one
line.
How likely is this?
Following
[Joseph-Ã‰mile Barbier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-%C3%89mile_Barbier),
we can split the randomness into two parts: the vertical position $y$ of the
needle's lower end, and it's angle to the horizontal, $\theta$.

    <div style="text-align:center"><img src

	</div>
	</figure>

We therefore take $y \in [0, D)$, and $\theta \in [0, \pi)$.
To see what the probability of hitting a line is, we note that the lower end of the needle will reach the upper line provided

$$
y \leq \ell \sin \theta.
$$

It's easy to see that, assuming the parameters $(\theta, y)$ for the random throw take a uniform distribution in the rectangle below, the probability is just the area of the region
below the line $y \leq \ell \sin \theta$, divided by the total area of the rectangle, $\pi D$.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/buffon2.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

The area $H$ below the line (green) can be calculated using calculus:

$$
H = \int_0^{\pi} \ell \sin \theta \, \text{d}\theta = \left[-\ell \cos\theta\right]^\pi_0
= \ell (\cos 0 - \cos \pi) = 2\ell.
$$

There is another very simple way to see this without using calculus.
Suppose you swing a slingshot around so that it executes a full revolution
every $2\pi$ seconds.
If the circle has radius $\ell$, the velocity (calculated by consider
a full revolution) is

$$
v = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} = \frac{2\pi \ell}{2\pi} = \ell.
$$

The velocity has two sinusoidally varying components: a horizontal
component, $v_x = \ell \sin \theta$ and a vertical component $v_y =
\ell \cos \theta$.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/buffon3.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

The horizontal velocity is exactly the curve of interest. The region
underneath the curve is the total *horizontal* distance covered in
half a revolution, since we are adding contributions of the form

$$
v_x \, \Delta \theta \approx \Delta x.
$$

But if we add up all the small changes $\Delta x$ in a
half-revolution, the total horizontal distance $A$ is obviously twice the
radius, or $H = 2\ell$. So no need for calculus!
Either we get there, the probability that the short needle hits the
line is

$$
P = \frac{2\ell}{\pi D}.
$$

#### Long needles and noodles

The above reasoning only works for short needles ($\ell < D$).
When $\ell > D$, the green curve will exceed the grey rectangle, and
the part outside does not contribute to the probability.
We can calculate its area and subtract, but its a bit tedious.
Let's see what we can do with the result we already have.
First, we can reformulate it a little.
Let $N$ be the number of times a short needle hits a line.
Our work above shows that the *expectation* is

$$
\langle N \rangle = 0 \cdot P(N = 0) + 1 \cdot P(N = 1) = P(N = 1) = \frac{2\ell}{\pi D}.
$$

Let's now consider a long needle, with $\ell > D$.
We can break it into some number of segments, say $n$, such that each is
shorter than $D$, with length $\ell_i$.
Let $N_i$, $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, label the number of times that
segment $i$ hits a line, and $N$ the *total* number of lines that the
long needle hits.
Then we have

$$
N = N_1 + N_2 + \cdots + N_n,
$$

and hence, by the linearity of averages and our results for short
needles,

$$
\begin{align*}
\langle N \rangle & = \langle N_1\rangle + \langle N_2 \rangle +
\cdots + \langle N_n \rangle \\
& = \frac{2\ell_1}{\pi D} + \frac{2\ell_2}{\pi D} + \cdots +
\frac{2\ell_n}{\pi D} \\
& = \frac{2(\ell_1 + \ell_2 + \cdots + \ell_n)}{\pi D} =
\frac{2\ell}{\pi D}.
\end{align*}
$$

So what do you know! The formula for the expected number of
crossings is the same, even though the probabilities will change
(the longer needle can hit multiple lines for instance).

    ="/images/posts/buffon4.png"/>

	</figure>

But something even more remarkable is true.
This result was independent of the relative orientation of the
segment, so it holds for a chain of line segments which twists and
turns.
And in fact, we can take the limit of $n \to \infty$, so that our
curve becomes *smooth*, and the result doesn't change.
We conclude that, for an arbitrary plane curve of length $\ell$ (such
as a noodle), the expected number of crossings is

$$
\langle N \rangle = \frac{2\ell}{\pi D}.
$$

Some wag called this *Buffon's noodle*.

#### Random noodles

Although the expected number of crossings is easy, in general, for a
fixed curve the actual probability distribution for $N$ is complicated.
But things simplify for a *random noodle* made of independent random
steps.
A physical example is a polymer, the long jointed molecules making up
plastics or DNA, or the path traced out in time by particles in a fluid.
Suppose the noodle is made from $n$ straight segments of length
$\ell_i < D$ and total length $\ell$.
Then each segment represents an independent "trial", and the joint
distribution is multinomial.
In the special case that the step lengths are the same, $\ell_i =
\lambda$, then the number of crossings obeys a binomial distribution
$\mathcal{B}(n, P)$ for $P = 2\ell/\pi D$.

#### Wheels and woodles

There is a final twist of the noodle comes from thinking about shapes which
have constant width.
