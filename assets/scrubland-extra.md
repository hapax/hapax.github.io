#### Does this approach work?

The [JUMP math program](https://www.jumpmath.org), founded by John
Mighton, is a primary-level approach to mathematics teaching.
The JUMP motto is that "every child can learn mathematics and love
it", and a maximin-type policy is enforced, with classes progresses
only once *all* students have mastered the material.
JUMP works by carefully building up basic skills,
[*The Myth of Ability*](https://jumpmath.org/jump/en/book_myth_ability), 

namely [guided discovery](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Guided_discovery_learning) and the core ethic tha.
The [data unambiguously show](https://www.jumpmath.org/jump/en/research_reports) that, at least for primary students, this
approach works wonders.
I am proposing a change in how we teach *secondary* mathematics, with
various other tweaks in emphasis and technique.
There may be wrinkles that arise from this difference in emphasis, but I would be surprised if the results were dramatically different.

#### Does maximin fail engaged students?

Maximin does not forbid writing questions for engaged students.
It only forbids questions which *only* engaged students can enjoy.
But bonus questions can help engage the class as a whole.
In the JUMP program, bonus questions are used as a carrot, dangled
just beyond the standard material, enticing students to finish that
material and move onto something "fun".
In his book [*The Myth of Ability*](https://jumpmath.org/jump/en/book_myth_ability),
John Mighton even recalls breaking up a fight by threatening to
withhold one of these bonus questions!
The point is that bonus questions can be for everyone, from the least
engaged (who will be incentivised) to the most enganged (who will be challenged).
There is no need for streaming!

#### Do your examples pass the maximin test?

The <a href="#sec-3">revised questions</a> seem challenging, but I
intend them to be taken in the spirit of JUMP's bonus questions: a
carrot for a globally engaged cohort who trust the teacher or text.
But bonus questions are not a blank cheque.
They only work once students have a basic level of self-efficacy and
engagement.
Even then, they still need to be designed deliberately, using a
careful model of what students know and where their zone of proximal
development is, chunking a difficult passage of reasoning
into small, achievable steps.
This is consistent with guided discovery and the
[constructivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education))
philosophy of teaching.

I've tried to chunk my questions this way, and aim for relatively low
prerequisites.
Without embedding them in a broader classroom context, perhaps the
only thing they demonstrate clearly is that high-school calculus has
exciting and nontrivial applications.
But this raises the question: if we abandon the scrubland, how *will*
students develop basic skills necessary to do bonus problems?

#### How do students develop basic skills?

As with JUMP, we can treat the aesthetic and real-world highlights as
bonus material, motivating students to slog through repetitious,
facility-building exercises.
But do these have to be shrubs?
The JUMP program shows that, with a careful constructivist
mindset, building basic skills need not be an interest-killing affair.
Let's try a similar thing with our <a href="#sec-1-2">earlier patch of
scrubland</a>.
Consider these two questions.

---

1. Differentiate the following and state the maximal domain:

	(a) $\sin^{-1}(x/3)\qquad$ (b) $\cos^{-1}(x^2)\qquad$ (c) $\tan^{-1}(\sqrt{x})$.

2. (a) Using the chain rule, find the derivative of $f(x) = \cos(\sin^{-1}(x))$.

	(b) Deduce from trigonometric identities that $f(x) =
    \sqrt{1-x^2}$.
	Do the domains match?
	Differentiate and check that your answer agrees with (a).

    (c) Implicitly differentiate $\cos^{-1} y = \sin^{-1} x$ and
    isolate the expression for $dy/dx$.
	Is this consistent with your previous answers?

---

Which is better?
I would argue that the second passes the shrub test while the first
does not, though they develop the same skills: differentiating inverse
trigonometric functions, using the chain rule, and identifying domains.

#### What should we assess?

The first question has its own dubious virtues.
The format (that is, lack of content!) leads to easy scaleability, which as
noted earlier, explains its appeal to textbook writers.
But it has two apparent pedagogical virtues: the psychological hack of
[associative learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning#Associative_learning)
by repetition, and its functional manifestation, the speedy execution of algorithms.
This is the logic of drill.

But what is the point of memorising inverse trigonometric derivatives?
Or being able to perform the differentiation quickly?
It's not clear.
I don't know these derivatives by heart, and I don't *need* to; I use
them rarely enough in my research that I just derive them if required.
Being able to derive them is the more useful skill!
In general, we place far too much emphasis on memorising
useless facts and reproducing them (or performing the associated
algorithms) speedily under exam conditions.

How should assessment look?
Consider this inspiring assignment question (from a
graph theory class with [David Wood](http://users.monash.edu.au/~davidwo/)):

---

Define a numeric measure of the complexity of a graph. Compute it for
several examples, and prove some properties about your measure. You
do not need to write more than 1 or 2 pages to get full marks.

---

This is exactly the sort of exploratory, open-ended thinking we need
to encourage.
A scrubland of drill trains students for the scrubland of assessment.
It does nothing to prepare them for the variety, complexity, and open-endedness of real life.

#### Does this work for pre-calculus topics?

Of course!
I literally chose calculus at random from the textbook.
*Any* mathematical topic has gorgeous theorems, freakish specimens,
and a rich history of real-world motivation and use.
Teaching trigonometry?
Perhaps Euclid is a little dry, but what about *non-Euclidean* geometry?
This is a wonderful place for guided discovery and exploration.
And what could be more empowering than determining the size of the
earth from the shadow of a stick, as
[Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth's_circumference)
did in 100 BC.
What about algebra?
Try the unsolvability of the quintic, compass and straightedge
constructions, and applications to dimensional analysis.
Logarithms?
Here we have the density of prime numbers, slide rules, algorithmic
complexity and Fermi estimates.
The list goes on.

Hopefully the idea is clear.
Pick a topic, any topic.
Figure out its history, where it comes from, what it's really used for
and what mathematicians or scientists find beautiful about it.
Now incorporate *that* material into the syllabus.
Mathematical skills live in a big constructivist framework, and
according to the maximin test, attention needs to be paid to
developing that framework so that all students can benefit.
But these goals are not at odds!

#### What is the teacher's role?

In the approach I'm suggesting, the role of the teacher seems to
be supplanted by a curriculum full of sparkling ideas and
fancy constructivist praxis.
But learning is a relational endeavour, and the teacher remains an
essential part of the process.
It is through the teacher that trust is established, students are
engaged, and the subject comes alive.
For all of this to happen, teachers need to be on top of the material!
If the syllabus now encompasses continuous but nowhere differentiable
functions, numerical approximation, diffusion, and self-organised
criticality, it seems like an impossible ask for all but the most
specialised of high school maths teachers.

But here's the thing: if students can learn it, so can teachers!
And if the syllabus is designed in an inviting, constructivist fashion
to reduce
[maths anxiety](https://www.cne.psychol.cam.ac.uk/math-memory/what-is-mathematics-anxiety)
in students, it should also reduce anxiety in teachers.
Perhaps, once they've left the scrubland, more teachers will be genuinely
enthusiastic about what they are teaching.
Their enthusiasm will be infectious.

#### What's next?

A single blog post is not going to overthrow secondary maths
education.
Instead of *replacing* the curriculum (an ambitious and long-term
goal), paths into the landscape can be offered as a complement to
traditional textbooks.
I'm currently [busy with a PhD](https://hapax.github.io/research), but
in the near future, I hope to start assembling a database of
extensions, theorems and applications, embedded in a constructivist
framwork and cross-referenced
against real curricula.
Watch this space!

## 5. Conclusion <a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

Teachers and curriculum writers are experts on modelling what students
know and how they come to know it.
Scientists and mathematicians are domain experts, with specialised
knowledge, taste, and judgment.
We need to stop marching students through the scrubland, and introduce
them to the vast topography of the real mathematical world, with its
majestic summits, calm valleys, and bestiary of strange creatures.
From this fertile soil, students can grow new plants, and in its caves
mine for patterns, fir for the as-yet-unknown
mathematical needs of the 21st century.
And just as important, they can enjoy the simple pleasures of mathematics which
have for so long, so unjustly and unnecessarily, been denied them.
