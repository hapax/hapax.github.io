I would like to thank Sogand and Aaliyah for inviting me to speak, all
of you for listening, and the Coast Salish peoples---the Squamish,
Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh---on whose unceded and ancestral territory
we are situated.
I'll be sharing a broad and personal perspective on what science is,
and what scientists do. But first of all, I'm going to talk about what science
is *not*, or at least, not primarily.

If I ask you to imagine a scientist, one of two stock types is likely
to pop into your head.
The first type is the industrious labrat, complete with labcoat, safety
goggles, and latex gloves, maybe peering into a microscope or wielding a
pipette.
These are the props of a scientist if we believe the
canonical stereotype, the one we see in films, television, books, and really
everywhere in popular culture.
Whatever its flaws, this stereotype has one saving grace: it is democratic; everyone can
aspire to wear a labcoat and look through a microscope.

The second stock type does not wear a labcoat,
and is more likely to be sporting, I don't know, a turtleneck
sweater or a tweed jacket and standing in front of a
blackboard. Instead of a microscope or pipette, their tools are chalk,
equations and ideas.
If we take the stereotype to its logical, or rather pop cultural,
extreme, they're probably white and male, confined to a wheelchair, or crazy,
or possessing an eccentric shock of white hair.
They are, in other words, scientific genius personified, the Albert
Einsteins and Stephen Hawkings and John Nashs. This is not a role most
of us feel invited to participate in.

Generally, scientists don't look like either of these pictures. And even
when they do, the stereotypes don't tell us what the scientist does, or
why they do it. All the stereotypes say is that you need to wear a labcoat, or be
a white guy with a talent for pushing symbols around, neither of which
is actually a prerequisite!
Nevertheless, these are narratives about science that can and do guide career
decisions, so I would like to tell you a counter-narrative about what
the prerequisites are, what a scientist does and why they do it.

Really, the main prerequisites are very simple.
All you need is the courage to admit you don't know something, and the
curiosity to wonder about the answer.
I'll give an example.
For two thousand years, we had it figured out. We knew why some things
fell to the ground, and why some things floated in the air, thanks to
the Greek philosopher Aristotle.
Aristotle tells us that different objects are made from different elements---earth, water, fire, and
air---and different elements are heavier or lighter, and move up or
down to find their level, and end up occupying these different strata,
from the dirt under your feet to the atmosphere to the fiery points
revolving far above us.
So if you release a helium balloon, it floats up because it's mainly
air, and air is light and likes to be high.
Conversely, if I take a clod of earth, and let it go, it
will drop back down to ground, where it belongs and likes to be.

Like I say, this was the accepted view for most of recorded history. But in 1665, Cambridge University closed due to fears of the
Black Plague---not so different from universities around the world
today---and one of its recent graduates, a lazy and
undistinguished young man, came home, had no more exams to study for,
no more tests to pass, and nothing better to do that to sit around and
ask idle questions. One of these idle questions concerned the motion of
the clod of earth, represented, for the lazy student, by an apple
falling from a tree.

"Why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the
earth's centre?" he wondered. Now, the apple is a combination of earth and water, so
if we believe Aristotle as most other people did, it just wants to find
its level. That's why it falls down. But the young man---who, as you may have guessed, was none
other than Isaac Newton---didn't understand this answer. He just didn't get it! What mechanism caused the apple to
move? What caused it stop? Why did it go to the centre? Why not
sideways a little? Aristotle didn't say. So Newton had to come up with
his own explanation. He very sensibly concluded that "assuredly, the earth draws it." In
other words, the earth pulls the apple towards it. Thus, he continues,
"there must be a drawing power in matter, and the sum of the drawing
power in the matter of the earth must be in the earth's center."

This little observation planted the seed for the most productive year
any human being has ever had, ever. A year later in 1666, the lazy student
invented Newtonian mechanics to explain how the apple started and
stopped moving, the law of gravitation to explain why it was pulled towards the
centre of the earth in the first place, and
then an entirely new branch of mathematics called calculus, to help
him solve some of the math problems that cropped up.
Now, Newton was smarter than the average bear, but that's not the
point. The point is that, in order to do any of that, he first needed
to ask the simple question: why does the apple fall? And he needed to
admit that he didn't understand Aristotle's answer. And in trying to
satisfy his own curiosity, he created physics and math as we know them
know.

The courage to admit you don't know, and the curiosity to ask; these
are the true prerequisites for being a scientist, not a labcoat or a
giant brain. I'm not going to deny that Newton had a giant brain. Not all of us
are going to invent a new branch of math just to solve problems in
the new branch of physics we just created! But Newton's achievements
are the achievements of an ordinary scientist writ large. He asked
questions, and with great tenacity, careful observation, and generous
hints from his predececssors, he answered them. And
that's what science is, whether you're studying physics or
oceanography or the social habits of lemurs, whether you approach
questions big or small or somewhere in between.
It's the same basic enterprise.

Newton would later write. "I do not know what I may appear to the
world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on
the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother
pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of
truth lay all undiscovered before me." And it's easy to read this and
think Newton is being modest, or even rather obnoxious. You were just
playing around the whole time? Come on! But I think that unlike the
stereotypes, Newton is actually giving us a very clear picture of why scientists do
what they do. They do what they do because they care about the
answers; because the answers are beautiful; because the questions are
beautiful. For Newton and scientists of all times, the universe really is
a seashore of smooth pebbles and pretty shells. And the microscopes
and pipettes and equations are all just a means to get closer to these
diverting objects, to know their nature better, and learn some of
their secrets.

There's another important lesson here. The pebbles and shells give us
hints about the nature of the ocean, since that's where they come from.
It might lie undiscovered in all its unfathomable depth before us, but it
scatters its clues on the shore.
The pebbles and shells are the small questions, thing like: why does an apple
fall? And not: what makes the world go round? Newton answered the big
question, but only because
he asked the little question first. So if we allow our curiosity to settle on the ordinary things, on the humble
things, the shells and pebbles, we may, like Newton, stumble onto
deeper truths in that undiscovered sea.

One of these deep truths is that everything is interesting.
This is one the perks of being a scientist; you get to see the
universe as a kind of fractal of wonder, exhibiting wonder in every
object and at every length scale. Einstein wrote a paper about tea
leaves and river bends; Richard Feynman,
another famous 20th century physicist, was stumped by snapping
spaghetti.
There is nothing more wonderful to a geneticist than an E. coli
bacterium, and to an entomologist, a puddle of stagnant water.
You get the idea.
Sometimes, people say that science, by insisting on explanations,
empties the universe of mystery and meaning.
But I think the opposite is true: it makes it full, and there is no
better place to seek mystery than the natural world.
You're not going exhaust it any time soon!
It's like the surface of a balloon; the more we know, the more we
realize we don't know.

Ultimately, science is an exercise in falling in love with
reality. You can wear anything you like. Your skin can be any
colour. You can be male, you can be female, you can be non-binary. It doesn't matter. As long as you
approach the universe with an open mind, with the humility to admit
that you don't know, the curiosity to ask, and enough love and wonder
to try and answer, then you have all that it takes, and probably much
more, to be a great scientist. And with that, I will conclude. Thank
you very much for listening.
