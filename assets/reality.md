I would like to thank Sogand and the organizers of this year's Quantum
Leaps Conference for inviting me to speak.
<!--  all of you in advance for listening, and the Coast
Salish peoples---the Squamish,
Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh---on whose unceded and ancestral territory
we are situated. -->
<!-- I'm David, a theoretical physicist at UBC, but I'm not going to be
specifically talking about physics today. -->
I'm a theoretical physicist. I study string theory and black holes, among
other things, and I welcome questions about these topics or any other
topics, including a day in the life, or my path to where I am today,
in the question session afterwards.
But instead of talking about these specific things, I'm going to be
sharing a broad perspective on what science is, and what scientists
do. And first of all, I'm going to talk about what science is *not*.

If I ask you to imagine a scientist, one of two stock types is likely
to pop into your head.
The first type is the industrious labrat, complete with white coat, safety
goggles, and pale blue latex gloves, maybe peering into a microscope or wielding a
pipette.
These are the props of a scientist if we believe the
canonical stereotype, the one we see in films, television, books, and really
everywhere in popular culture.
But whatever its flaws, this stereotype has one saving grace: it's
democratic. Everyone can aspire to wear a labcoat and look through a microscope.

The second stock type doesn't wear a labcoat,
and is more likely to be sporting a turtleneck
sweater or a tweed jacket and standing in front of a
blackboard. Instead of a microscope or pipette, their tools are chalk,
equations and ideas.
If we take the stereotype to its logical, or rather pop cultural,
conclusion, they're probably white and male, and could be confined to
a wheelchair, or schizophrenic, or possessing a big frizz of white hair.
In other words, they are scientific genius personified, the Albert
Einsteins and Stephen Hawkings and John Nashs. This is not a role most
of us feel invited to participate in.

But in general, scientists don't look like either of these pictures. And even
when they do, the stereotypes don't tell us what a scientist does, or
why they do it. All the stereotypes say is that you need to wear a labcoat, or be
a white guy with a talent for pushing symbols around, neither of which
is actually a prerequisite!
Nevertheless, these are narratives about science that can and very
often do guide career
decisions---I mean, we've been exposed to them all our lives---so I would like to tell you some counter-narratives about what
the prerequisites are. <!-- , what a scientist does and why they do it.-->

Really, the main prerequisites are very simple.
All you need is the courage to admit you don't know something, and the
curiosity to wonder about the answer.
I'll give an example.
For two thousand years, we had it figured out. We knew why some things
fell to the ground, and why some things floated off into the air, thanks to
the Greek philosopher Aristotle. He told us that different objects
were made from different elements---earth, water, air, and fire---which
were heavier or lighter, and therefore moved up or down to find
their level.
This explains why the dirt is under our feet, the
atmosphere is layered over the top of it, and the fiery pinpricks of starlight
revolve far above.

If I take a clod of earth, and let it go, Aristotle says it will
drop back down to the ground because the ground is where it belongs and likes to
be. That was the accepted view for most of recorded history. But in 1665,
Cambridge University closed due to fears of the
Black Plague---not so different from universities around the world
today---and one of its recent graduates, a lazy and
undistinguished young man, came home, had no more exams to study for,
no more tests to pass, and nothing better to do that to sit around and
ask idle questions. One of these idle questions concerned the motion of
the clod of earth, represented, for the lazy student, by an apple
he saw fall from a tree.

"Why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the
earth's centre?" he wondered. Now, the apple is a combination of earth and water, so
if we believe Aristotle as most other people did, it just wants to find
its level. That's why it falls down. But the young man---who, as you
may have guessed by now, was Isaac Newton---didn't understand this answer. He just didn't get it! What mechanism caused the apple to
move? What caused it stop? Why did it go to the centre? Why not
sideways a little? Aristotle didn't say. So Newton had to come up with
his own explanation. He very sensibly concluded that "assuredly, the earth draws it." In
other words, the earth pulls the apple towards it. Thus, he continues,
"there must be a drawing power in matter, and the sum of the drawing
power in the matter of the earth must be in the earth's center."
That's why it gets pulled to the center of the earth.

This little observation planted the seed for the most productive year
any human being has ever had, ever. In 1666, the lazy student
invented Newtonian mechanics to explain how the apple started and
stopped moving, the law of gravitation to explain why it was pulled towards the
centre of the earth in the first place, and
then an entirely new branch of mathematics called calculus, to help
him solve some of the math problems that cropped up.
Now, Newton was smarter than the average bear, but that's not the
point. The point is that, in order to do any of that, he first needed
to ask the simple question: why does the apple fall? And he needed to
admit that he didn't understand Aristotle's answer. And in trying to
satisfy his own curiosity, he more or less created math and physics as we know them.

The courage to admit you don't know, and the curiosity to ask; these
are the true prerequisites for being a scientist, not a labcoat or a
giant brain. I'm not going to deny that Newton had a giant brain. Not all of us
are going to invent a new branch of math to solve problems in
the new branch of physics we just created! But Newton's achievements
are the achievements of an ordinary scientist writ large. He asked
questions, and with great tenacity, careful observation, and generous
hints from his predececssors---standing on the "shoulders of giants"
as he put it---he answered them. And
that's what science is, whether you're studying physics or
oceanography or the social habits of lemurs, whether you approach
questions big or small or somewhere in between.
It's the same basic enterprise.

Newton would later write. "I do not know what I may appear to the
world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on
the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother
pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of
truth lay all undiscovered before me." And it's easy to read this and
think Newton is being modest, or even rather obnoxious. You were just
playing around the whole time? Come on! But I think that unlike the
stereotypes, Newton is actually giving us a very clear picture of why scientists do
what they do. They do what they do because they care about the
answers; because the answers are beautiful; because the questions are
beautiful. For Newton and scientists of all times, the universe really is
a seashore of smooth pebbles and pretty shells. And the microscopes
and pipettes and equations are all just a means to get closer to these
diverting objects, to know their nature better, and learn some of
their secrets.

There's another important lesson here. The pebbles and shells give us
hints about the nature of the ocean, since that's where they come from.
It might lie undiscovered in all its unfathomable depth before us, but
the sea scatters its clues on the shore.
The pebbles and shells are the small questions, thing like: why does an apple
fall? And not: what makes the world go round? Newton answered the big
question, he explained why the world goes round, but only because
he asked the little question first. So if we allow our curiosity to settle on the ordinary things, on the humble
things, the shells and pebbles on the beach, we may, like Newton, stumble onto
deeper truths in that undiscovered sea.

And one of these deep truths is that everything is interesting.
This is one of the perks of being a scientist; you are part of a
human-operated scheme for turning the universe into a fractal of
wonder, something which exhibits wonder in every object and at every
length scale.
There is nothing more wonderful to a geneticist than a bacterium; to an entomologist, than a puddle of stagnant water; a wildlife
conservationist, whale poop; and a soft matter theorist, watching
paint dry.
You get the idea!
But you don't need to take other people's word for it.
You can dive into this fractal, and allow yourself to
become interested in everything!
Einstein wrote a paper about tea
leaves and river bends; Richard Feynman,
another famous 20th century physicist, was stumped by the problem of
snapping spaghetti; mathematician Jean Taylor spent years proving
results about soap bubbles, and Kenneth Libbrecht wrote a 500-page
book about snowflakes. Everything is interesting.

Sometimes, people say that science reduces the world to a bunch of
moving parts, to mere cause and effect, and thereby empties it of meaning.
But I think the opposite is true: it makes it full.
The 19 stars which form the constellation we call Orion, for instance,
have a rich history of human interpretation. To the ancient
Babylonians, these stars represented Anu, the heavenly shepherd and
chief of the gods; to the ancient Egyptians, it was the destination of the
pharaoh's spirit after death; it was a giant to the Arab astronomers;
a fool to the Hebrews; and a hunter, not only to the Greeks, who gave
it the name Orion, but the Magyars of Hungary, the Seri people of
Mexico, and the Chuckchi of Siberia.

But as colourful and varied as they are, these images pale in
comparison to the splendour of creation itself.
Each of the 19 points in this dot-to-dot is a vast
thermonuclear furnace, formed millions or billions of years ago from
collapsing clouds of dust, and with a tortuous life history of its own.
One of the brightest stars in the constellation is Betelguese, a star so huge that,
if we put it in the center of our solar system, it would swallow Jupiter.
Betelguese is a renegade.
It grew up in a pocket of debris humorously called the OB1
Association, and perhaps as a result of some Star Wars, it got kicked
out, and now hurtles through space at 30 km/s.
As it travels through the interstellar medium (which is a light
sprinkling of hydrogen and other elements) its magnetic field
kicks atoms out of the way, forming what's called a bow shock, the
same way that the prow of a boat creates a wake as it displaces water. 
The magnetic wake of Betelguese is three times wider than our solar system, and if
you happen to have an infrared telescope, it's visible as a brilliant
curve of light, marking the passage of this lonely ship through the
deeps of space.

There are many more things I could say about Betelguese, but this
is a single star, one of 19 in the constellation of Orion, which is
one of hundreds of constellations that humans of different times and
places have invented, using only the stars visible to the
naked eye. These visible stars, in turn, are a mere sliver of the
total number of stars in the galaxy, and our galaxy is one of
billions. Like the sun, we expect most of these stars to have planets,
and for some of these planets to have their own inhabitants, and for
some of these inhabitants to form their own stories and pictures from
the bright stars in their vicinity. Perhaps, every now and again, they
ask why things fall.

Each star, planet, and organism, each atom of the interstellar
medium, even empty space itself, each of these moving parts is a constellation to the scientist, a
dot-to-dot onto which they project scientific images and meanings, and
which change as new data points become visible or old ones
dim and disappear.
For every human culture which has looked up at Orion and seen
something different, there is a subfield of astronomy or physics or
chemistry which looks up and sees the same diversity in Betelguese.
The Renegade has just as many stories to tell as the Hunter. But
unlike Orion, they are stories about itself rather than something else.
And in a universe so much older, larger, and stranger than anything
the ancient myths prepared us for, we need new stories to orient
us, preferably those told by the objects themselves and woven into the
world. <!-- Science provides them.; it makes the universe full.-->
The job of the scientist is to listen and interpret.
Of course we make errors, we mishear, we misunderstand, or interpret after our own
bias. But at the end of the day, we come back to what the world is
trying to tell us; because we care about the underlying stories, the
process is self-correcting.
Broadly put, science is the act of falling in love with reality,
listening to its stories, and filling it with meaning.

So, to be a scientist, you don't need a labcoat. You can wear anything you like. Your skin can be any
colour. You can be male, female, or non-binary. It doesn't matter. As long as you
approach the universe with an open mind, with the humility to admit
that you don't know, the curiosity to ask, and enough love and wonder
to listen to reality's answer, then you have all that it takes, and probably much
more, to be a great scientist. Thank you. <!-- And with that, I will conclude. Thank
you very much for listening. -->

<!-- They are much stranger than anything dreamt of in our mythologies.
Science tells us that the force which pulled the apple, and
hauls the earth, governs the shape and fate of the
cosmos.
It tells us that there is a rare, self-replicating substance called
life, and on at least one planet, it has come to know itself.
Science is really just life, this exotic material, falling in love
with reality and filling it with meaning. -->

<!-- I'll conclude by returning to our original question: how to be a
scientist if we can't trust the stereotypes. -->

<!-- Far from being empty, the universe is a tapestry of densely interwoven
stories, more complex and awesome and strange than any human mythology
has dared to imagine. -->

<!-- Ultimately, science is the act of falling in love with
reality and its endless constellations.-->

<!-- The universe, in all its awe and complexity and strangeness, is far fuller
than any mythology ever dared to imagine. -->

<!-- Sometimes, people say that, by insisting on explanation and -->
<!-- testability, science empties the universe of meaning. But I think -->
<!-- the opposite is true: it makes it full, and there is no better -->
<!-- place to seek mystery than the natural world. You’re not going -->
<!-- exhaust it any time soon! It’s like the surface of a balloon; the -->
<!-- more we know, the more we realize we don’t know. What is most of -->
<!-- the universe made of? How many universes are there? Do quantum -->
<!-- wavefunctions collapse? What happens inside a black hole? And why -->
<!-- does spaghetti always snap into three pieces? The mysteries of -->
<!-- the world are endless. -->

<!-- It tells us that the force which drew the apple, and hauls the
