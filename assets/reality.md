I would like to thank the organizers of the Quantum Leaps conference
for inviting me to speak, all of you for listening, and the Coast
Salish peoples---the Squamish, Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh---on
whose unceded and ancestral territory we are situated.
I'll be sharing a broad and personal perspective on what science is,
and what scientists do. But first of all, I'm going to talk about what science
is *not*, or at least, not primarily.

If I ask you to imagine a scientist, one of two stock types is likely
to pop into your head.
The first type is the industrious labrat, complete with white coat, safety
goggles, and latex gloves, maybe peering into a microscope or wielding a
pipette.
These are the props of a scientist if we believe the
canonical stereotype, the one we see in films, television, books, and really
everywhere else in popular culture.
Whatever its flaws, this stereotype has one saving grace: it is democratic; everyone can
aspire to wear a labcoat and look through a microscope.

The second stereotype does not wear a lab coat,
and is more likely to be sporting, I don't know, a turtleneck
sweater or a tweed jacket and standing in front of a
blackboard. Instead of a microscope or pipette, their tools are chalk,
equations and ideas.
If we take the stereotype to its logical, or rather pop culture,
extreme, they're probably white and male, confined to a wheelchair, or crazy,
or possessing an eccentric shock of white hair.
They are, in other words, the stock type of scientific genius, the Albert
Einsteins and Stephen Hawkings and John Nashs. This is not a role most
of us feel invited to participate in.

Generally, scientists don't look like either of these pictures. And even
when they do, the stereotypes don't tell us what the scientist does, or
why they do it. All the stereotypes say is that you need to wear a labcoat, or be
a white guy with a talent for pushing symbols around, neither of which
is actually a prerequisite!
Nevertheless, these are narratives about science that can guide career
decisions, so I would like to tell you a counter-narrative about what
the prerequisites are, what a scientist does and why they do it.

Really, the main prerequisite is very simple.
All you need is the courage to admit you don't know something, and the
curiosity to wonder about the answer.
I'll give an example.
For two thousand years, we had it figured out. We knew why some things
fell to the ground, and why some things floated in the air.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle tells us that different
objects are made from different elements---earth, water, fire, and
air---and different elements are heavier or lighter, and naturally
occupy different strata.
If you release a helium balloon, it will float up, because it's mainly
air, and air is light and likes to be high.
Conversely, if I take a clod of dirt, and let it go, it
will drop back down to ground, where it belongs and likes to be, below
the air.

Like I say, this was the accepted view for most of recorded history. But in 1665, Cambridge University closed due to fears of the
Black Plague---not so different from universities around the world
today---and one of its recent graduates, a lazy and
undistinguished young man, came home, had no more exams to study for,
no more tests to pass, and nothing better to do that to sit around and
ask idle questions. One of these questions concerned the motion of
the clod of earth, personified, for the lazy student, by an apple.

"Why should it not go
sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre?" he
wondered. Of course, the apple is a combination of earth and water, so
if we believe Aristotle as most other people did, it just wants to find
its level. But the young man---who, as you may have guessed, was none
other than Isaac Newton---didn't understand this explanation. He just didn't get it! What mechanism caused the apple to
move? What caused it stop? Why did it go to the centre? Why not
sideways a little? Aristotle didn't say. So Newton had to come up with
his own explanation. He concluded that "assuredly, the earth draws it." In
other words, the earth pulls the apple towards it. Thus, he continues,
"there must be a drawing power in matter, and the sum of the drawing
power in the matter of the earth must be in the earth's center."

This little observation carried the seed for the most productive year
any person, at any time, in any walk of life, has ever experienced. In
1666, the lazy student invented Newtonian mechanics to explain how the apple started and stopped
moving, the law of gravitation to explain why it was drawn towards the centre of the earth, and
then an entirely new branch of mathematics called calculus, to help
solve some of the math problems that cropped up.
Now, Newton was smarter than the
average bear, but that's not the point. The point is that, in order to
do any of that, he first needed to ask the simple question: why does the
apple fall? And then he needed to admit that he didn't understand the
answer everybody else gave. And in trying to satisfy his own
curiosity, he gave us modern physics and maths.

The courage to admit you don't know, and the curiosity to ask; these
are the true prerequisites for being a scientist, not a labcoat or a
giant brain. And certainly, Newton had a giant brain; not all of us
are going to invent new branches of mathematics to solve problem in
the new branch of physics we just created, but Newton's achievements
are the achievements of an ordinary scientist writ large. He asked
questions, and with great tenacity, careful observation, and generous
hints from his predececssors, he answered them. And
that's what science is, whether you're studying physics or
oceanography or the social hierarchy of lemurs.

Newton would later write. "I do not know what I may appear to the
world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on
the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother
pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of
truth lay all undiscovered before me." And it's easy to read this and
think Newton is being modest, or even rather obnoxious. You were just
playing around the whole time? Come on! But I think that unlike the
stereotypes, Newton is actually giving us a very clear picture of why scientists do
what they do. They do what they do because they care about the
answers; because the answers are beautiful; because the questions are
beautiful. For Newton, and for most scientists, the universe really is
a diverting seashore of smooth pebbles and pretty shells. And the microscopes
and pipettes and equations are all just a means to get closer to the
pebbles and shells, and to know their nature.

To put it differently, science is an exercise in falling in love with
reality. You can wear anything you like. Your skin can be any
colour. You could be male, you could be female, you can identify as
something else altogether. It doesn't matter. As long as you
approach the universe with an open mind, with the humility to admit
that you don't know, the curiosity to ask, and enough love and wonder
to try and answer, then you have all that it takes, and probably much
more, to be a good scientist. And with that, I will conclude. Thank
you very much for listening.
