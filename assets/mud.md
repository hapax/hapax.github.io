**April 18, 2021.** *Cracks in a drying mud puddle form a network of
  T-intersections. A parent crack generates a baby crack, so in
  principle, we can read off the history of the puddle. In practice,
  this history is almost never unique, and instead leads us to a
  computationally intractable problem in order theory.*

#### Introduction

The surface of a drying mud puddles contracts as water evaporates.
This creates a stress on the surface, relieved by introducing
*cracks*.
These cracks will form from microscopic flaws in the surface,
described by
[fracture mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fracture_mechanics),
and in particular criteria for failure developed by A. A. Griffith and
modified by G. R. Irwin.
