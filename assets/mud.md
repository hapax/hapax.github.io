**April 18, 2021.** *Cracks in a drying mud puddle form a network of
  T-intersections. A parent crack generates a baby crack, so in
  principle, we can read off the history of the puddle. In practice,
  this history is almost never unique, and instead leads us to a
  computationally intractable problem in order theory.*
