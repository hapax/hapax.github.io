Welcome to the Hacker’s Guide to Physics!
This short lecture series is designed to introduce modern physics
using basic high school maths, and is a virtual successor to the
[UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/).
A (rapidly evolving) outline of planned topics is below.

The first lecture will be on **Thursday, May 14**.
Stay tuned for further details!

#### Lecture outline

1. **Dimensional analysis** (*Thursday, May 14*)
<!-- - Dimensions vs measurements -->
<!-- - The algebra of dimensions -->
<!-- - Buckingham π -->
<!-- - Fundamental constants -->
2. **Fermi estimates** (*date TBA*)
<!-- - Linear vs logarithmic rulers -->
<!-- - Geometric means -->
<!-- - Factorisation -->
<!-- - Generalised units -->
3. **Random walks** (*date TBA*)
<!--- Square root scaling -->
<!--- Polymers -->
<!--- Collisions -->
<!--- Brownian motion? -->
<!-- 4. **Thermodynamics** - Ideal gas law - Brownian motion - Energy -->
<!-- and entropy - The laws of thermodynamics 5. **Quantum -->
<!-- mechanics** - Polarisers and Stern-Gerlach - Superposition and -->
<!-- measurement - Entanglement - Quantum key -->
<!-- distribution 6. **Special relativity** - The triangle -->
<!-- inequality - Maximal proper time - Geodesics - Time, length and -->
<!-- energy 7. **Advanced topic 1** 8. **Advanced topic 2**  - -->
<!-- Fractals and scaling laws - Electromagnetism - Soap bubbles - -->
<!-- Black holes - White dwarfs - Feynman diagrams - Cosmology - -->
<!-- General relativity - Oscillators - Physical limits on computation -->

#### What's the big idea?

Nowadays, a "hacker" is someone who breaks into computers.
But there is an older use of the term referring to a spirit of play,
exploration, and creativity in technical matters.
In the words of open-source guru Richard Stallman,

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
[Hackers] wanted to be able to do something in a more
exciting way than anyone believed possible and show 'Look how
wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done.'
</span>

In this older sense, "hacking" is about using technical insights to
do impossible things.
Examples include
[student pranks at MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacks_at_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) or
the [Lego inket printer](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~page/lego.html)
made by Larry Page (co-founder of Google).

Hackers do not look for the most powerful, or obvious,
or easy tool for the job.
They delight in using humble means to achieve the extraordinary.
Viewed this way, we can hack physics just as well as we can hack Lego blocks or a campus
building.

We will try to approach physics with the hacker spirit of physicists
like [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_einstein)
or
[Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman),
discovering deep facts about the world using simple tools. In a
motto:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
*Deep facts from cheap hacks.*
</span>

You don't need complicated math to share quantum secrets, size up a
black hole, or probe the genome of E. coli; just the back of a napkin
and couple of hacks.
So, join us as we hack our way to the heart of modern physics!
