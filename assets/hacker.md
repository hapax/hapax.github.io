Welcome to the hacker's guide to physics!
The goal of these notes (and accompanying videos) is to teach you how
to think like a physicist without needing a degree or any advanced
mathematics.
Over the course of
eight lectures, we'll cover everything from trigonometry to special
relativity.

##### Basic

1. <a href="#sec-1">Math review</a>
2. <a href="#sec-2">Physics review</a>
3. <a href="#sec-3">Dimensional analysis</a>
4. <a href="#sec-4">Fermi estimates</a>

##### Intermediate

5. <a href="#sec-5">Random walks</a>
6. <a href="#sec-6">Thermodynamics</a>
7. <a href="#sec-7">Special relativity</a>
8. <a href="#sec-8">Quantum mechanics</a>

##### Advanced (options)

- Fractals and power laws
- Soap bubbles
- Epidemiology and COVID-19
- Black holes
- The Chandrasekhar limit
- Cosmology
- General relativity
- Physical limits on computation
- $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots = -1/12$
