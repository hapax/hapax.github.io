### Introduction

Welcome to the Hacker’s Guide to Physics! The goal is to provide an
introduction to modern physics using basic high school maths.
This is a virtual successor to the
[UBC Physics Circle](https://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/events/metro-vancouver-physics-circle/).
A (rapidly evolving) outline of planned topics is below, but the first
few lectures will be based on
[this blog post](https://hapax.github.io/physics/teaching/hacks/napkin-hacks/).

The first lecture will be on **Thursday, May 14**.
Stay tuned for further details!

### Lecture outline

1. **Dimensional analysis** (*Thursday, May 14*)
<!-- - Dimensions vs measurements -->
<!-- - The algebra of dimensions -->
<!-- - Buckingham π -->
<!-- - Fundamental constants -->
2. **Fermi estimates** (*date TBA*)
<!-- - Linear vs logarithmic rulers -->
<!-- - Geometric means -->
<!-- - Factorisation -->
<!-- - Generalised units -->
3. **Random walks** (*date TBA*)
<!--- Square root scaling -->
<!--- Polymers -->
<!--- Collisions -->
<!--- Brownian motion? -->
<!-- 4. **Thermodynamics** - Ideal gas law - Brownian motion - Energy -->
<!-- and entropy - The laws of thermodynamics 5. **Quantum -->
<!-- mechanics** - Polarisers and Stern-Gerlach - Superposition and -->
<!-- measurement - Entanglement - Quantum key -->
<!-- distribution 6. **Special relativity** - The triangle -->
<!-- inequality - Maximal proper time - Geodesics - Time, length and -->
<!-- energy 7. **Advanced topic 1** 8. **Advanced topic 2**  - -->
<!-- Fractals and scaling laws - Electromagnetism - Soap bubbles - -->
<!-- Black holes - White dwarfs - Feynman diagrams - Cosmology - -->
<!-- General relativity - Oscillators - Physical limits on computation -->

### What's the big idea?

Nowadays, a "hacker" is someone who breaks into computers.
But there is an older use of the term referring to a spirit of play,
exploration, and creativity in technical matters.
In the words of open-source guru Richard Stallman,

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
What [hackers] had in common was a love of excellence and
programming... They wanted to be able to do something in a more
exciting way than anyone believed possible and show 'Look how
wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done.'
</span>

Examples include
[student hacks at MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacks_at_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology),
or the
[inket printer](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~page/lego.html)
that Larry Page (co-founder of Google) made out of Lego as a PhD
student.
Randall Munroe, author of webcomic [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/), is
perhaps the most well-known hacker in the world.

Using techniques in a clever or unexpected way is a *hack*.
Hackers (in this sense) do not look for the most powerful, or obvious,
or easy tool for the job.
They delight in the unexpected, in using humble means to achieve
extraordinary ends.

We can hack physics just as well as we can hack Lego blocks or a campus
building.
Our goal will be:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
*To learn powerful things about the world using the simplest possible means.*
</span>

You don't need complicated maths to share quantum secrets, weigh the
largest tree in the world, or estimate the size of a bacterial genome;
just a few simple tools and some high school maths.

We will follow in the footsteps of great physics hackers like
[Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_einstein) and
[Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman).
