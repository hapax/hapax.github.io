Welcome to the hacker's guide to physics!
The goal of these notes (and accompanying videos) is to teach you how
to think like a physicist without needing a degree or any advanced
mathematics.
Over the course of
eight lectures, we'll cover everything from trigonometry to special
relativity, Newtonian to quantum mechanics.
We'll calculate the radius of the earth, build a space
elevator, see why clouds float and calculate the likelihood of
intelligent life in the galaxy.

##### Basic

1. <a href="#sec-1">Math review</a>
2. <a href="#sec-2">Physics review</a>
3. <a href="#sec-3">Dimensional analysis</a>
4. <a href="#sec-4">Fermi estimates</a>

##### Intermediate

5. <a href="#sec-5">Random walks</a>
6. <a href="#sec-6">Thermodynamics</a>
7. <a href="#sec-7">Special relativity</a>
8. <a href="#sec-8">Quantum mechanics</a>

##### Advanced (options)

- Black holes
- Cosmology
- Curvature and general relativity
- The Chandrasekhar limit
- Fractals and power laws
- Epidemiology and COVID-19
