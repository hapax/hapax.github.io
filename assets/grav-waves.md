Hey, so just to clarify the 1/r scaling thing, a radiation field by
definition has amplitude scaling as 1/r, since it is thing responsible
for carrying energy away. What is weird about gravitational waves is
that radiation is associated with changing quadrupole moments rather
than changing dipole moments as in electromag.
Incidentally, I think there is a slick high-level argument. A
gravitational wave has two indices (it is a wavelike perturbation to a
matrix describing the shape of space) so it cannot be associated to a
vector quantity like a dipole. The quadrupole is also a matrix, so
Lorentz invariance (and dimensional analysis) give us the equation
Jess wrote down.
