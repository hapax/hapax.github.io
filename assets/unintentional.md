I want to extol a certain aesthetic mood, based on combinatorial
play, coincidence, and an effort to encounter objects in themselves.
It is a mood which frames aesthetic phenomena (as distinct from art) as the universe at play.
I think this attitude is closely related to creativity more broadly,
and scientific creativity in particular.
There is a close connection to natural beauty and the sublime, but for
reasons of space I will softpedal this link.

This attitudes contrasts with the way we usually treat objects --- as
*symbols* (or more properly signs) pointing to absent referents.

## White magic

Joseph Cornell made art from leftovers.
Over a lifetime, mostly spent living with his mother and disabled
brother in a small apartment in Queens, he collected used books,
postcards, toys, household objects, and turned them into three-dimensional collage or *assemblage*.

The eye is the best of artists... And as the eye is the best composer, so light is the first of painters.

I’m speaking about a quest for quoz, of which I’ll say more as we go
along, but until then, you might want to see Quoz as a realm filled
with itself as a cosmos is with all that’s there, not just suns and
planets and comets but dust and gas, darkness and light, and all we
don’t know, and only a fraction of what we can imagine.

The eye is the best of artists...
There is no object so foul that
intense light will not make beautiful.
