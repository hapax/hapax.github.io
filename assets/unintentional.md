**September 11, 2019.** *Unintentionality in art.*

## What "makes" art?

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
The eye is the best of artists.... And as the eye is the best composer, so light is the first of painters.
There is no object so foul that
intense light will not make beautiful. And the stimulus it affords to
the sense, and a sort of infinitude which it hath, like space and
time, make all matter gay.

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
White is just what I mean. Not monstrously, but in wonderful
variations. All I want to perform is white magic.
</span>
