**January 7, 2021.** *Some thoughts on simplices embedded in the intersection of hypercubes and
  hyperspheres, motivated by the game Spot It! (aka Dobble).*

#### Introduction

The game of *Spot It!* (called *Dobble* in the UK) is a simple game
based on some relatively deep mathematics.
There is a deck of $55$ cards, each of which has eight symbols printed
on it, from a total symbol vocabulary of $57$.
For each two cards in the deck, there is precisely one symbol in
common, and on each round, the first person to find the shared symbol
between the last card and a newly drawn card wins a point.
