**January 7, 2021.** *Some thoughts on simplices embedded in the
  intersection of a hypercube and a hypersphere, motivated by the game Spot It! (aka Dobble).*

#### Introduction

The game of *Spot It!* (called *Dobble* in the UK) is a simple game
based on some relatively deep mathematics.
There is a deck of $55$ cards, each of which has eight symbols printed
on it, from a total symbol vocabulary of $57$.
For each two cards in the deck, there is precisely one symbol in
common, and on each round, the first person to find the shared symbol
between the last card and a newly drawn card wins a point.
Eight is a good number since, according to
[Miller's "law"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two),
the number of objects the average human can hold in short-term memory
is seven.

I enjoy the game, but like many mathematically-minded folk who play
it, became distracted by the question: how does it work?
Somewhat nontrivially, as it turns out.
It turns out to involve a wonderful overlap of
[pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_geometry) and
[applied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design)
mathematics, and there are many resources (see below) for learning
more. I'm going to consider a slightly different approach.

#### Some generalisations

The usual approach is to consider an alphabet of $n$ symbols, a deck
of size $d$, and $\ell$ symbols per card, satisfying the constraint
that every two cards share precisely one symbol in common.
If we add the further constraint that each pair of symbols occurs on
one card only, then we have a nice equivalence to
[finite projective geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane),
provided we interpret a card as a line and a symbol as a point of
intersection, with "axioms"

1. Any two lines (cards) intersect at exactly one point (symbol).
2. Any two points (symbols) are joined by exactly one line (card).

The question is 
It's possible to prove that this is only possible if, for some number
$q$,

$$
n = q^2 + q + 1.
$$
