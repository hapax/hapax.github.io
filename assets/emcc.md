#### A Pythagorean prelude

Relativity is really just the bizarro version of trigonometry.
To make this clear, we start by presenting Pythagoras' theorem in a
slightly odd way.
Suppose we have rulers, $x$ and $y$, oriented at right angles
[<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>],
and which both have evenly spaced marks.
An $x$ division need not equal a $y$ division, and in general will
correspond to $\Lambda$ units of $y$.
We can measure lengths, say of a plank of wood, in this system, by
simply recording the number of marks it takes up on ruler $x$, call it
$\Delta x$, and the number of marks taken up on $y$, called $\Delta
y$.
Pythagoras’ theorem means that, however we choose to orient the plank
of wood or the rulers themselves, we always find

$$
d^2(\Delta x, \Delta y) = \Delta x^2 + \Lambda^2 \Delta y^2 = L^2,
$$

for some fixed number $L$, depending only on the piece of wood we've
chosen to measure.
It seems reasonable to define $L$ as its length.
But even more importantly, the quantity $d^2$ *doesn't change with relative orientation*.

Relativity parallels this setup closely.
Michelson and Morley's
[famous experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)
in 1887 suggested that the speed of light does not depend on how you
go when you measure it.
Einstein arrived at the same conclusion by thinking long and hard
about electrodynamics.
To measure the speed of light, we use two rulers, $x$ and $t$, though
the latter is usually called a "clock".
The light travels between two points a distance $\Delta x$ apart in
time $\Delta t$, so the speed is $c = \Delta x/\Delta t$.
But we can rewrite this suggestively as

$$
s^2(\Delta x, \Delta t) = \Delta x^2 - c^2 \Delta t^2 = 0.
$$

The analogy is hopefully clear.
Let's assume $s^2(\Delta x, \Delta t)$ obeys a version of Pythagoras’
theorem for *spacetime*, meaning that the value of the expression does
not change when we speed up or slow down.
This varies the relative orientation of the light ray with respect to
the rulers, but the "spacetime length" $s^2 = 0$ remains the same.
