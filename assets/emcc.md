**February 13, 2021.** *A*

#### A Pythagorean prelude

Pythagoras's theorem states that if we have a right triangle with
short sides $a$, $b$ and long side (hypotenuse) $c$, they obey

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2. \tag{1} \label{pythag}
$$

This is a mathematical theorem proved by Pythagoras or one of his
followers.
But the result was known much earlier, for instance by Babylonian surveyors.
It's possible they thought of it as a mathematical result, but in many
ways, our ideas of what constitutes theorem and proof was invented by
the Greeks.
More likely, the surveyors regarded (\ref{pythag}) as a useful
*empirical* fact about distance.

We're going to give a fanciful interpretation of this.
Suppose as surveyor has two perpendicular rulers, call them $X$ and
$Y$, with evenly spaced marks on each.
The spacing on $X$ need not equal the spacing on $Y$.
