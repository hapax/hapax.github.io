**February 13, 2021.** *A*

#### A Pythagorean prelude

Pythagoras's theorem states that if we have a right triangle with
short sides $a$, $b$ and long side (hypotenuse) $c$, they obey

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2. \tag{1} \label{pythag}
$$

This is a mathematical theorem proved by Pythagoras or one of his
followers.
But the result was know earlier, for instance by Babylonian surveyors.
It's possible they thought of it as a mathematical result, but in many
ways, the idea of theorem and proof was invented by the Greeks.
More likely, the surveyors regarded (\ref{pythag}) as a useful
*empirical* fact about distances.
