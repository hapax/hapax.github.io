I'm David Wakeham, a PhD student in the
[string theory](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~strings/) group at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (UBC).
I'm interested in gravity, quantum information and black holes; see
[Research](https://hapax.github.io/research/) for more.
I am generously supported by a UBC
[International Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/campus-community/meet-our-students).

Before moving to Vancouver in Fall 2017, I completed a masters degree
in particle physics at the
[University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/).
I have undergraduate degrees in maths and philosophy.
Further biographical details are in my CV (available on request).
