Hi! I'm David.
My elements formed from exploding stars billions of years ago, but
self-organised into a human more recently.
I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the [string theory group](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~strings/) at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), Vancouver.
<!-- studying
conformal field theory, quantum information and black holes.
I am generously supported by a UBC
[International Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/campus-community/meet-our-students/wakeham-david). -->
<!-- I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia.-->
<!-- , and picked up degrees in
philosophy, maths, and physics along the way. -->
<!-- My CV is available if you ask nicely.-->
