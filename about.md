I'm David Wakeham, a PhD student in the
[string theory](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/~strings/) group at the
[University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (UBC) studying [gravity, quantum field theory and black holes](https://hapax.github.io/research).
I am generously supported by a UBC
[International Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/campus-community/meet-our-students/wakeham-david).

I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, where I completed
degrees in maths, philosophy, and physics.
Further academic details can be found in my CV (available on request).
