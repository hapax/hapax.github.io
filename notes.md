### Outreach

- [*Entanglement and quantum secrecy*](assets/entanglement.md)
  (2017). A presentation for the
  [Melbourne Maths and Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/The-Melbourne-Maths-and-Science-Meetup/?_cookie-check=NJLWsx1HvuPx1Rgb) 
  on entanglement and quantum key distribution.
  Although the talk was pitched at a general audience, the notes here
  are slightly more technical.
- [*Quantum computing in flatland*](assets/quasi-qcomp.md)
  (2016). A talk on anyons (particles with fractional spin) and how they
  might be used in quantum computing. Aimed at undergraduates.
- [*Black hole thermodynamics*](assets/bh-thermo.md)
  (2015, revised 2018). An introduction to black hole thermodynamics for undergraduates.

### Teaching

- [*Random walks with hungry bacteria*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/random.pdf) (2018). A short problem set
  on random walks, from the perspective of a hungry *E. coli*
  bacterium.
- [*Problems in classical mechanics*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/classical-tutes-full.pdf) (2016). Tutorials
  on classical mechanics for a
  [second year physics course](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/phyc20014)
  at the University of Melbourne.
- [*Problems in Fourier analysis*]({{
  hapax.github.io}}/assets/fourier-tutes-full.pdf) (2016). Tutorials
  on wave mechanics and Fourier analysis for the same subject. I also wrote two assignments: one on
  [higher-dimensional donuts]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a2.pdf),
  and another on
  [Fourier analysis at the beach]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/physical-systems-a3.pdf).

### Technical

- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
  hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). A quick introduction
  to string perturbation theory and calculus on Riemann
  manifolds. The basic conclusion is that, by simply propagating
  through space, a string can hear the shape of every Riemann surface!
  The final project for a course on string theory.
- [*Inflation: inhomogeneities and spectra*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). Notes on inflation for a
  seminar course on cosmology. The goal is to explain how classical
  late-time structure in the universe can be the result of early
  quantum ripples.
- [*The functional equation for Riemann's zeta*](assets/zeta.md)
  (2015). A self-contained proof of the functional equation
  for Riemann's zeta function. Mainly written for my own edification.
- [*Time-travelling qubits*](/assets/ctc-qm.md) (2014). Undergraduate
  coursework project on quantum
  mechanics and closed timelike curves (CTCs). If they are consistent, CTCs are magical quantum doodads for finding fixed points.
