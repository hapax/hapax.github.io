In the tradition of dorky, maximalist websites, here are a few things I enjoy when I'm not doing science.

### Books

I'm an avid reader, and spend a lot of time/money fossicking for
books. Here are some resources for fellow bibliophiles:
- [*Vancouver bookstores*](reviews/bookstores.md). A field guide to used bookstores in
Vancouver. 
- [*Desert island library*](reviews/booklist.md). Some books I like.
- [*Reviews*](reviews/reviews.md). Opinions about books.

### Programming

I code for fun in [Python](https://www.python.org/)
(it's quick), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (it's beautiful) and
[Processing](https://processing.org/) (it's visual). A few small
projects are listed below:

- [*Genesim*](https://github.com/hapax/genesim). Simulate the random
distribution of genetic code around a family tree.
- [*Partitions*](https://github.com/hapax/haskell-partitions). Experimental
  partition identities in Haskell, now with [blog post](mathematics/programming/haskell-partition/)!
- [*OpenProcessing*](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/89003). A
collection of Processing sketches.

### Visual art

I like drawing and making digital art.
