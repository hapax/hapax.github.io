In the tradition of dorky, maximalist websites, here are a few things I enjoy when I'm not doing science.

[//]: # ### Writing/reading

[//]: # I'm an avid reader, and spend a lot of time/money fossicking
[//]: # for books. I've written a short field guide to Vancouver's
[//]: #[used bookstores](reviews/bookstores.md) for fellow
[//]: # bibliophiles.

[//]: # I also do some [writing](/writing.md) myself!

### Coding

I code for fun.
A selection of minor projects:

- [*Genesim*](https://github.com/hapax/genesim). Simulate the random
distribution of genetic code around a family tree.
- [*Partitions*](https://github.com/hapax/haskell-partitions). Experimental
  partition identities in Haskell, now with [blog post](https://hapax.github.io/mathematics/programming/haskell-partition/).
- [*OpenProcessing*](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/89003). A
collection of Processing sketches.

### Art

I like drawing and making digital art.
I have drawn for [Discorder magazine](https://www.citr.ca/discorder/),
and did a [commissioned piece](images/collision.jpg) for the
[Collision exhibit](http://www.coepp.org.au/events/collision-exhibition)
at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, 2016.
See my [art](/art.md) page for more.
