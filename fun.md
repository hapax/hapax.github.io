In the tradition of dorky, maximalist websites, here are a few things
I enjoy when I'm not doing science.

[//]: # ### Writing/reading

[//]: # I'm an avid reader, and spend a lot of time/money fossicking
[//]: # for books. I've written a short field guide to Vancouver's
[//]: #[used bookstores](reviews/bookstores.md) for fellow
[//]: # bibliophiles.

[//]: # I also do some [writing](/writing.md) myself!

### Coding

I code for fun and occasionally for work. A few languages I use:
- For scientific computing, [Python](https://www.python.org/) is now
  reasonably fast and fully-featured when combined with
  [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/).
- [Processing](https://processing.org/) is a great way to create
  interactive/visual sketches.
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is probably the most beautiful
programming language in the noosphere. It has a reputation for
difficulty, since a lot of abstract mathematics is baked into it, but
there are many excellent and free resources for learning it.
For instance,
  - [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) for a
    quick-and-dirty intro;
  - [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) for
    the practically minded;
  - [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)
  for the mathematically minded.
- One of these days, I hope to go even further down the formalist
  rabbit hole and learn some [Homotopy Type Theory](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/).
  
A couple of minor projects, polished enough to make available:

- [*Genesim*](https://github.com/hapax/genesim). Simulate the
distribution of genetic code around a family tree.
- [*Partitions*](https://github.com/hapax/haskell-partitions). Experimental
  number theory, now with [blog post!](https://hapax.github.io/mathematics/programming/haskell-partition/)
- [*OpenProcessing*](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/89003). A
collection of Processing sketches.

### Art

I like drawing and making digital art.
I occasionally put stuff on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/holotwin/), but hope to
find/make a more suitable home at some point.
