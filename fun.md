### Art

I like drawing and making digital art.
See my [art](/art.md) page for more.

### Writing/reading

I'm an avid reader, and spend a lot of time/money fossicking
for books. I've written a short field guide to Vancouver's
[used bookstores](reviews/bookstores.md) for fellow
bibliophiles.
I also do some [writing](/writing.md) myself!

### Coding

I do a little coding for fun.
Here are some small projects:

- [*Genesim*](https://github.com/hapax/genesim). Simulate the random
distribution of genetic code around a family tree.
- [*Partitions*](https://github.com/hapax/haskell-partitions). Experimental
  partition identities in Haskell, now with [blog post](https://hapax.github.io/mathematics/programming/haskell-partition/).
- [*OpenProcessing*](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/89003). A
collection of Processing sketches.
