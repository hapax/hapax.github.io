### Art

I like drawing and making digital art.
See [Art](/fun.md) for more, or my (somewhat out-of-date)
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/holotwin/) account.

### Writing/reading

I like [Writing](/writing.md).
I'm also an avid reader, and spend a lot of time/money fossicking for
books. Here are some notes for fellow bibliophiles:
- [*Vancouver bookstores*](reviews/bookstores.md). A field guide to used bookstores in
Vancouver. 
- [*Desert island library*](reviews/booklist.md). Some books I like.
- [*Reviews*](reviews/reviews.md). Opinions about books.

### Coding

I do a little coding for fun.
Here are some small projects:

- [*Genesim*](https://github.com/hapax/genesim). Simulate the random
distribution of genetic code around a family tree.
- [*Partitions*](https://github.com/hapax/haskell-partitions). Experimental
  partition identities in Haskell, now with [blog post](https://hapax.github.io/mathematics/programming/haskell-partition/).
- [*OpenProcessing*](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/89003). A
collection of Processing sketches.
