In the tradition of dorky, maximalist websites, here are some
non-science activities I enjoy.

[//]: # here are a few things I enjoy when I'm not doing science.

### Art

Under construction!

### Coding

I code for fun and occasionally work. Languages I use:
- For scientific computing, [Python](https://www.python.org/) is now
  reasonably fast and fully-featured when combined with
  [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/).
- [Processing](https://processing.org/) is a great way to create
  interactive/visual sketches.
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is probably the most beautiful
programming language in the noosphere. It has a reputation for
difficulty, since a lot of abstract mathematics is baked into it, but
there are many excellent and free resources for learning it, such as:
  - [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) for a
    quick-and-dirty intro;
  - [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) for
    the practically minded; and
  - [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)
  for the mathematically minded.
  
Here are a few projects:
- [*Genesim*](https://github.com/hapax/genesim). Simulate the
distribution of genetic code around a family tree.
- [*Partitions*](https://github.com/hapax/haskell-partitions). Experimental
  number theory, now with [blog post!](https://hapax.github.io/mathematics/programming/haskell-partition/)
- [*OpenProcessing*](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/89003). A
collection of Processing sketches.

### Writing/reading

Buying and reading second-hand books is my principal vice. Some
annotated lists:
- [*Vancouver used bookstores*](reviews/bookstores.md). A short field
guide for fellow bibliophiles.
- [*Book reviews*](reviews/reviews.md). Some longer book reviews.

I also dabble in writing myself. A couple of recent efforts:
- [*Arrest*](assets/arrest.pdf) (2019). Sci-fi flash fiction about the
  psychology of time. Winner of the [Ubyssey
  2019 sci-fi contest](https://www.ubyssey.ca/sci-fi-contest/).
- [*Fearful Spheres*](assets/fearful-spheres.pdf) (2018). A short
  chapbook of poetry.

[//]: # - [*Desert Island fiction*](reviews/fiction-list.md). Fiction I really like.

[//]: # I also do some [writing](/writing.md) myself!

[//]: # ### Art

[//]: # I like drawing and making digital art.

[//]: # I have illustrated for [Discorder magazine](https://www.citr.ca/discorder/),
[//]: # and did a commissioned piece for the
[//]: #[Collision exhibit](http://www.coepp.org.au/events/collision-exhibition)
[//]: # at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, 2016.
