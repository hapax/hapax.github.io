In the tradition of dorky, maximalist websites, here are some things I
do when I'm not sciencing or encouraging other people to science.

#### Writing

I like writing sci-fi. Some recent flash fiction:

- ["Arrest"]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/arrest.pdf) (2019). Telekinetic
zombies, science gone mad, and the psychology of time. Winner of the
[2019 Ubyssey sci-fi competition](https://www.ubyssey.ca/science/arrestee-sci-fi-winner-2019/).
- ["A post-quantum fantasia"]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/pqf.pdf)
(2020). A farcical "what if" about large-scale quantum computing,
geopolitics, and mating shrimp.

In a prior life I earned a philosophy degree, and still take language
on holiday from time to time. Some rambling discursions:

- *Language, cognition and alien math*
  [[1](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/alien-maths-1/)] (2020,
  blog post). Is it possible to get inside the head of a bat?
  And what does this tell us about alien math?
- [*From solipsism to emergent time*](https://hapax.github.io/physics/philosophy/emergent-time/)
  (2020, blog post). Time is different from space. What
  would a good physical explanation of this fact look like?
- [*The endless present*](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/)
  (2019, blog post). A four-dimensionalist account of the psychology
  of time, concluding with a radical version of eternal recurrence.
<!-- - [*Cigarettes, hard labour, and a box full of money*](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/prisoners/)
(2017, blog post). How decision problems, from the Prisoner's Dilemma
to smoking to betting against the Oracle of Delphi, are secretly
  related.
<!-- What nuclear war, smoking, and the Oracle of Delphi have in -->
<!-- common. -->

#### Art

I put my digital art on [tumblr](https://caedrix.tumblr.com/)
(yes, it still exists) and photos of urban decay, chance Cornellian
arrangements of rubbish, symmetry, patterns, and so forth, on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dr__abe/).

#### Programming

<!-- I code for fun and occasionally profit in [Python](https://www.python.org/)
(it's quick), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (it's beautiful) and
[Processing](https://processing.org/) (it's visual). -->
I code for fun and occasionally profit. A few small projects:

- [*University of Melbourne course planner*](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/your-course/manage-your-course/planning-your-course-and-subjects/faculty-course-planning-resources/course-planning-tools). I
  designed the prototype version of the university's course
  planner. I've linked the snazzy beta version by the folks at [Eliiza](https://eliiza.com.au/about/).
- [*Genesim*](https://github.com/hapax/genesim). Simulate the random
distribution of genetic code around a family tree.
- [*Partitions*](https://github.com/hapax/haskell-partitions). Experimental
  number theory in Haskell, now with [blog post](https://hapax.github.io/mathematics/programming/haskell-partition/)!

Here are some fun
[Processing](https://processing.org/)/[p5js](https://p5js.org/) sketches:

- [*Gothic window simulator*](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/571835). Program for drawing gothic window tracery.
- [*Pong mania*](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/590092). A buggy but addictive implementation of Pong. <!-- of which I am
  inordinately proud.-->
