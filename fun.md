In the tradition of dorky, maximalist websites, here are some things I like doing when I'm not sciencing or encouraging other
people to science.

### Writing

I like writing science fiction and other stuff. Some recent sci-fi flash fiction:

- ["Arrest"]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/arrest.pdf) (2019). Telekinetic
zombies, science gone mad, and the psychology of time. Winner of the
[2019 Ubyssey sci-fi competition](https://www.ubyssey.ca/science/arrestee-sci-fi-winner-2019/).
- ["A post-quantum fantasia"]({{hapax.github.io}}/assets/pqf.pdf)
(2020). A somewhat farcical "what if" about large-scale quantum
computers and geopolitics.

I'm interested in philosophy (in fact, in a prior life I earned a
philosophy degree). Thoughts on various topics:

- [*The endless present*](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/)
  (2019, blog post). A radical version of eternal recurrence.
- [*Cigarettes, hard labour, and a box full of money*](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/prisoners/) (2017, blog post).

### Programming

I code for fun in [Python](https://www.python.org/)
(it's quick), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (it's beautiful) and
[Processing](https://processing.org/) (it's visual). A few small
projects are listed below:

- [*Genesim*](https://github.com/hapax/genesim). Simulate the random
distribution of genetic code around a family tree.
- [*Partitions*](https://github.com/hapax/haskell-partitions). Experimental
  partition identities in Haskell, now with [blog post](https://hapax.github.io/mathematics/programming/haskell-partition/)!
- [*Gothic window simulator*](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/571835). Program for drawing basic gothic window tracery.
- [*Pong mania*](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/590092). A
  buggy but addictive implementation of Pong. <!-- of which I am inordinately proud.-->

### Art

I put my recent digital art on [tumblr](https://caedrix.tumblr.com/)
(yes, it still exists) and photos of urban decay, chance Cornellian
arrangements of rubbish, symmetry, patterns, and so forth, on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dr__abe/).
