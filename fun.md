In the tradition of dorky, maximalist websites, here are some
other things I like doing.

### Programming

I code for fun in [Python](https://www.python.org/)
(it's quick), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) (it's beautiful) and
[Processing](https://processing.org/) (it's visual). A few small
projects are listed below:

- [*Genesim*](https://github.com/hapax/genesim). Simulate the random
distribution of genetic code around a family tree.
- [*Partitions*](https://github.com/hapax/haskell-partitions). Experimental
  partition identities in Haskell, now with [blog post](https://hapax.github.io/mathematics/programming/haskell-partition/)!
- [*Gothic window simulator*](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/571835). Program for drawing basic gothic window tracery.
- [*Pong mania*](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/590092). A
  buggy implementation of Pong of which I am inordinately proud.

### Art

I put my recent digital art on [tumblr](https://caedrix.tumblr.com/)
(yes, it still exists) and photos of urban decay, and so forth, on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dr__abe/). Both accounts are in states of mild abeyance.
