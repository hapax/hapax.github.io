title:  "By Night in Chile (Roberto Bolaño)"

The tragicomic deathbed reflections of a conservative Jesuit priest
and amateur poet. One of Bolaño's earlier efforts, *By Night in Chile*
is a boisterous parody of Chilean culture and politics under Pinochet,
but lacks the engine of dread driving Bolaño's magnum opus, *2666*, or
the understated melancholy of *The Savage Detectives*. The reader can
see shades of future work, most obviously in the fractured, reflexive
take on the Latin American literati and a Bolaño doppelgänger, the
"wizened youth". The anecdote of Maria Canales and the body in the
basement, however, gives a first hint at the oases of horror to
come...
