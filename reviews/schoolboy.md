Robert Walser was popular in his day, and admired by giants
of German-language literature like Herman Hesse, Robert Musil and Kafka.
But his literary star faded quickly; he died, poor and obscure, in
the Waldau sanitorium where he spent the last 20 years of his life.
Recent years have seen a Walser revival, with a critical reappraisal (the blurb sports
glowing endorsements from Susan Sontag and Elias Canetti) and a raft
of translations and reissues, including this short story collection
(the second of three) from
[The New York Review of Books](https://www.nyrb.com/collections/robert-walser).

*A Schoolboy's Diary* starts with Walser's first published work: a
 series of classroom essays by Fritz Kocher, a (fictional) schoolboy.
We learn in the metafictional preface that Kocher died shortly after
 leaving school (we never learn how), and Walser has
 persuaded the reluctant mother to let him "publish" the exercises.
Casting the stories as the juvenilia of a dead youth is, perhaps, a gesture of
 self-effacement, the alibi of a writer eager to disappear into the
 page.
But Kocher is the perfect skin for Walser to inhabit: at once
 guileless and wise, Kocher is learning the

Walser seduces the reader in spite of himself.

 But it sets up a tension between: Kocher's essays are wise and moving, with a floating, oneiric quality
 that as W.G. Sebald put it, has a "tendency to dissolve upon
 reading".

Kocher's essays provide an overture for the whole collection, a
statement of its main themes: the simple pleasures of community and
nature; the more complicated pleasures of writing; and in opposition
to these two, duty both in the abstract and to the Fatherland.

Walser's stories are simple and sweetly disarming. This collection
takes its thematics cues from the essays of Fritz Kocher, a . The style is self-effacing, with a floating, oneiric quality.

Walser's "prose has the tendency to dissolve upon reading, so that
only a few hours later one can barely remember the... things of which
it spoke."
Walser also called him a "clairboyant of the small"; 
This helps explain why Walser was so quickly forgotten.

But not forever. In the sanitorium, where Walser was confined 

Short prose pieces make up the bulk of Walser's ouevre, composed in an
idiosyncratic, miniaturist style.
He called them "micrograms":, which he even began to encrypt during his confinement in Waldau.
Recently, a whole tranche (the "Pencil Zone") was deciphered for the
first time, kickstarting a Walser revival, complete with critical
reappraisal and a surge of translations and reissues.

[The New York Review of Books](https://www.nyrb.com/collections/robert-walser)
is in on the game, publishing three story collections and a novel.
The first collection, *A Schoolboy's Diary*, is organised around the
essays of Fritz Kocher.
