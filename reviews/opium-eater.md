As a fan of confessional literature, biography, and psychedelic
counterculture, I thought this would be the literary equivalent of a
good sandwich. I was disappointed. De Quincey is an excellent prose
stylist and often quite funny in a dry, scholastic way. These virtues
are overshadowed by bouts of sensationalism, mawkishness, and
self-promotion. You will probably be bored by the third allusion to
Democritus.
