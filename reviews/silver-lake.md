*Spoiler alert: major spoilers.*

*Under the Silver Lake* is a strange and bloated creature, shambling
the LA foothills on a private acid trip and dragging bewildered
viewers along for the ride.
On paper, it's a mess: from its lurching, hare-brained plot twists and
incoherent mythology, to the revolving door of disposable and oversexed femme fatales.

But the film is so assured in its weirdness, so clearly driven by some
disquieting internal logic, that I can't stop thinking about it.

But the film is driven by some shaggy, disquieting logic, which I may
not understand, but found weirdly compelling.
It is a flawed film, and those flaws are not subtle.
It's hard to figure out what drives it.
The film's big reveals are either bathetic (e.g. the absurd sequence
with the Songwriter) or coy, more like a sinister joke
third feature from writer/director
[David Robert Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Robert_Mitchell)
(*It Follows*, *The Myth of the American Sleepover*)
The moments when the film is supposed to reveal something, or explain
what's going on, we get moments of bathos: the Songwriter with
his , or the pharaonic millionaires
There is no character development; the plot is incoherent and
bathetic; like the X Files, it seems to cramming too many different
mythologies into a single
The pervy, adolescent humour is pervy and adolescent, with dispensable, oversexed female
characters who are thrown away when it suits the plot.
The plot is incoherent and bathetic, 
One subplot unfolds a tinfoil-hat conspiracy involving secret messages
in pop songs.
This is personified by the Songwriter, who claims to written half the
century's hits, including grunge anthem *Smells Like Teen Spirit* to
the protagonist's murderous dismay.
In one subplot, we learn that secret messages are hidden
in pop songs, some intended for the super wealthy,  including (shock horror!) grunge
anthem *Smells Like Teen Spirit*, as the protagonist learns to his
murderous dismay in a particularly bathetic scene.
In a second, tangentially related subplot, we discover that
millionaires are being buried alive in vast underground complexes,
with TV, modern kitchens, and a harem of nubile groupies 

The film's pervy, adolescent humour is matched by a cast of oversexed
femme fatales thrown away as soon as it suits the story.
In one subplot, we learn that pop songs are being encoded with hidden
messages for the rich and ideological guff for the masses.
It's not exactly deep stuff, and reaches a low point when our
hero confronts an establishment hack about *Smells Like Teen Spirit*.
Some critics have compared it to David Lynch's masterpiece of headfuck psychodrama,
*Mulholland Drive*.
The plot lurches from one hare-brained reveal to
another, never really landing any of its narrative punches.
But the film is so assured in its weirdness, so clearly driven by some
disquieting internal logic, that I found it mesmerising despite its flaws.
