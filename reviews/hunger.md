*Hunger*, Knut Hamsun's 1890 protomodernist novel, is a first-person
 account of a destitute Norwegian intellectual and his unsuccessful
 efforts to find work. The narrator, a sort of hapless Scandinavian
 Raskolnikov, wanders around Oslo, becoming more delirious, eccentric,
 and depressed as his savings dwindle. The later passages of the book
 are among the most vivid and unsettling in 19th century literature. A
 gripping read.
