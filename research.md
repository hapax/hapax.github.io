### What do I do?

I study string theory and quantum gravity, with a particular focus
on the AdS/CFT correspondence.
This is the wacky proposition that
gravity in certain (*d*+1)-dimensional spacetimes can be
described by non-gravitational quantum mechanics in *d* dimensions.
For instance, a 3D black hole can be simulated on a 2D quantum computer!

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/er=epr.png"
    width="55%" />
		    <figcaption><i>A 3D black hole on a 2D quantum
    computer.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

Right now, I'm interested in how this correspondence changes when we
add boundaries to the quantum mechanical system, and what insights
this can provide into various puzzles regarding black holes.

#### Posters and talks

- [*Black holes and large c BCFTs*](assets/bcft2-poster.pdf) (2019). Poster for
  [Quantum Information and String Theory 2019](https://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~qist2019/index.php),
  held at the
  [YITP](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/research/fields/research-institutes/yukawa-institute-for-theoretical-physics-yitp.html),
  Kyoto University, Japan.
- [*Boundary state black holes*](assets/melb-18-slides-short.pdf)
  (2018). Seminar delivered once to
  [particle theorists](http://www.coepp.org.au/), and again to
  [gravitational wavers](https://www.ozgrav.org/),
  at the University of Melbourne.

### Technical notes and talks
- [*Chaos and thermalisation*](assets/chaos.pdf) (2018). In quantum
  mechanics, "chaotic" can mean either "looks random" or "spreads exponentially
  quickly". A talk on both notions to the neutron star
  group at the University of Melbourne.
- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). In string
theory, loop diagrams are Riemann surfaces, leading to a beautiful
connection between scattering and geometry. Final project for a string
theory course.
- [*Inflation: inhomogeneities and spectra*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). Early quantum wrinkles equal
  late-time structure! Notes on inflation for a student seminar at the University of Melbourne.
