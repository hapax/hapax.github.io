I study quantum mechanics and gravity, with a particular focus on the
AdS/CFT correspondence.
At the moment, I'm interested in boundary conformal field theories,
black holes, quantum information and statistical mechanics.
For a short technical overview, see my [thesis proposal](assets/proposal.pdf).

<!--   - From the CFT perspective, we prove that if you chop a holographic
   CFT_2 in half, you sometimes cleanly slice the bulk. We give
   precise sufficient conditions for this clean slicing (called the
   AdS/BCFT dictionary, and conjectured long ago) but as far as I
   know, stating conditions like this is a first. We also provide
   neat applications to looking inside black holes, proving some
   results of [4] and [5] microscopically. -->
3. [*Eigenstate thermalization and disorder averaging in gravity*](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.021601)

   DW. PRL, 125:021601. arXiv:
   [2002.02971](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02971.pdf).
<!--   - In a chaotic theory, averaging correlators of random states
   creates wormhole-like shortcuts between replicas of the
   theory. This applies to high energy states of a CFT and black
   holes, sure, but also your kettle or a molybdenum nucleus. -->

  [1912.05746](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05746.pdf).
<!--  - When the AdS/BCFT equivalence holds, the results of prodding
  the bulk slice should be compatible with the corresponding prodding
  in the CFT. We give a general recipe for learning bulk equations of
  motion from this compatibility requirement, and show the simplest
  version of AdS/BCFT obeys it. -->

<!--  - We cut holes in various theories which, by the magic of
    AdS/(B)CFT, are dual to evaporating black holes. These configurations
    shed light (or rather Hawking radiation) on the black hole
    information problem. -->

<!--  - We cut holes in various theories which, by the magic of
    AdS/(B)CFT, are dual to black hole microstates. These microstates
    look like the Big Bang/Big Crunch FRW spacetimes relevant to
    cosmology, so perhaps we live on an end-of-the-world brane behind
    a black hole horizon! Probably not, but it's a conversation opener.-->

#### Miscellaneous notes/talks

- [*Maxwell's demon goes to Vegas*](assets/gambling-demons.pdf)
  (2020). Can demons playing thermodynamic slot machines violate the
  second law, i.e. make free energy for free? Yes! Showing this
  involves some neat results from the theory of martingales.
- [*MIP\* = RE*](assets/mipre.pdf) (2020). Consulting entangled
  provers makes you a god, in the sense that they can quickly and reliably
  convince you of "yes" answers to the Halting Problem. This tells us something deep about the nature of entanglement and
  operator algebras.
  <!-- Notes on [this (big) result](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383) for a group talk. <!--, showing that entangled provers can convince you of almost anything.-->
- [*Sphere packing and the modular bootstrap*](assets/sphere-packing.pdf)
  (2019). Surprisingly, throwing balls in a box constrains the
  lightest black holes in certain theories of quantum gravity. The
  connection is linear programming! <!-- Rough notes for a talk on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01319).-->
- [*Chaos and thermalisation*](assets/chaos.pdf) (2018). In quantum
  mechanics, "chaotic" can mean either "looks random" or "spreads
  quickly". A brief introduction to both notions.
- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). To paraphrase
Mark Kac, propagating strings hear the shape of every Riemann
surface. I explain what this means in terms of the path integral and
moduli space of a string loop amplitude.
- [*The inflationary spectrum*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). If you want phenomenological
  constraints for your crazy pet GUT, you could do worse than go
  outside with a microwave camera and look at the night sky. Seminar
  talk on perturbations in cosmological inflation.
