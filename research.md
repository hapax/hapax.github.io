### What do I do?

I work on string theory and quantum gravity, with a particular focus
on the AdS/CFT correspondence.
This is the crazy-sounding (but extremely well-tested) proposition that
quantum gravity in (*d*+1)-dimensional, saddle-shaped space is exactly
equivalent to a regular quantum theory in *d* dimensions.
For instance, a 3D black hole can be simulated on a 2D quantum computer!

At the moment, I'm thinking about what happens when you slice the
*d*-dimensional quantum theory in half.
It seems like this splits the saddle-shaped space in a
controllable way.
With some sleight of hand, we can even split a *wormhole* in half, and use
half a quantum computer to describe the interior of a black hole!
