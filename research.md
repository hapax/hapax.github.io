My Torsor research can be found at [the website](https://torsor.io).
At Xanadu, I was interested in the intersection of symmetry,
statistical learning, and quantum algorithm; see my
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00172) for more details.
In my PhD, I focused on the black hole information problem, and how
methods from boundary conformal field theory can help us solve it.
For a short technical overview, see my
[thesis proposal](assets/proposal.pdf); for a slightly longer technical overview, see my [thesis](assets/ubc_2022_november_wakeham_david.pdf).

<!--   - From the CFT perspective, we prove that if you chop a holographic
   CFT_2 in half, you sometimes cleanly slice the bulk. We give
   precise sufficient conditions for this clean slicing (called the
   AdS/BCFT dictionary, and conjectured long ago) but as far as I
   know, stating conditions like this is a first. We also provide
   neat applications to looking inside black holes, proving some
   results of [4] and [5] microscopically. -->
3. [*Eigenstate thermalization and disorder averaging in gravity*](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.021601)
   (2020). Jason Pollack,
  Moshe Rozali, James Sully,
   DW. PRL, 125:021601. arXiv:
   [2002.02971](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02971.pdf).
<!--   - In a chaotic theory, averaging correlators of random states
   creates wormhole-like shortcuts between replicas of the
   theory. This applies to high energy states of a CFT and black
   holes, sure, but also your kettle or a molybdenum nucleus. -->
5. [*Information radiation in BCFT models of black holes*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP05(2020)004.pdf)
  (2019). Moshe Rozali,
 James Sully,
 Mark Van Raamsdonk,
 Christopher Waddell,
  DW. JHEP, 2020:4. arXiv:
  [1910.12836](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12836.pdf).
<!--  - We cut holes in various theories which, by the magic of
    AdS/(B)CFT, are dual to evaporating black holes. These configurations
    shed light (or rather Hawking radiation) on the black hole
    information problem. -->
6. [*Black hole microstate cosmology*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FJHEP07%282019%29065.pdf)
  (2018). Sean Cooper, Moshe Rozali,
  [Brian Swingle](https://sites.google.com/site/physicsmonkey/),
 Mark Van Raamsdonk,
  Christopher Waddell, DW. JHEP, 2019:65. arXiv:
  [1810.10601](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10601).
<!--  - We cut holes in various theories which, by the magic of
    AdS/(B)CFT, are dual to black hole microstates. These microstates
    look like the Big Bang/Big Crunch FRW spacetimes relevant to
    cosmology, so perhaps we live on an end-of-the-world brane behind
    a black hole horizon! Probably not, but it's a conversation opener.-->

#### Miscellaneous notes/talks

- [*Maxwell's demon goes to Vegas*](assets/gambling-demons.pdf)
  (2020). Can demons playing thermodynamic slot machines violate the
  second law, i.e. make free energy for free? Yes! Showing this
  involves some neat results from the theory of martingales.
- [*MIP\* = RE*](assets/mipre.pdf) (2020). Consulting entangled
  provers makes you a god, in the sense that they can quickly and reliably
  convince you of "yes" answers to the Halting Problem. This tells us something deep about the nature of entanglement and
  operator algebras.
  <!-- Notes on [this (big) result](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383) for a group talk. <!--, showing that entangled provers can convince you of almost anything.-->
- [*Sphere packing and the modular bootstrap*](assets/sphere-packing.pdf)
  (2019). Surprisingly, throwing balls in a box constrains the
  lightest black holes in certain theories of quantum gravity. The
  connection is linear programming! <!-- Rough notes for a talk on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01319).-->
- [*Chaos and thermalisation*](assets/chaos.pdf) (2018). In quantum
  mechanics, "chaotic" can mean either "looks random" or "spreads
  quickly". A brief introduction to both notions.
- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). To paraphrase
Mark Kac, propagating strings hear the shape of every Riemann
surface. I explain what this means in terms of the path integral and
moduli space of a string loop amplitude.
- [*The inflationary spectrum*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). If you want phenomenological
  constraints for your crazy pet GUT, you could do worse than go
  outside with a microwave camera and look at the night sky. Seminar
  talk on perturbations in cosmological inflation.
