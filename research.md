I study quantum mechanics and gravity, with a particular focus on
*holography*, also called the *AdS/CFT correspondence*.
For technical details, see my papers.
For a light-hearted lay summary, see below.

#### Other technical notes and talks
- [*Chaos and thermalisation*](assets/chaos.pdf) (2018). In quantum
  mechanics, "chaotic" can mean either "looks random" or "spreads exponentially
  quickly". A talk on both notions to the neutron star
  group at the University of Melbourne.
- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). In string
theory, loop diagrams are Riemann surfaces, leading to a beautiful
connection between scattering and geometry. Final project for a string
theory course.
- [*Inflation: inhomogeneities and spectra*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). Early quantum wrinkles equal
  late-time structure! Notes on inflation for a student seminar at the University of Melbourne.

#### Lay research summary

Gravity describes large, heavy objects like planets, galaxies and black holes.
Quantum mechanics describes small, fuzzy things like electrons
orbiting the nucleus, or [cats trapped in radioactive boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat).
But if we add many of these small fuzzy things together, they must be
described by *both* gravity and quantum mechanics.
Because gravity and quantum
mechanics usually apply to such radically different domains, they are hard to reconcile, and a combined theory of *quantum
gravity* is one of the holy grails of theoretical physics.

Although quantum gravity in full generality remains mysterious,
we have a simple but miraculous example called the *AdS/CFT
correspondence*.
It tells us that quantum gravity in a special (*d+1*)-dimensional
spacetime (Anti-de Sitter = AdS) is exactly equivalent to quantum
mechanics in *d* dimensions (conformal field theory = CFT).
For instance, a 3D black hole can be run on a 2D quantum computer!
Although this change in dimension (*d* + 1 â†’ *d*) seems impossible, it
is actually *expected* as a general feature of quantum gravity, and in
AdS/CFT it is realised in a beautiful way: the CFT system lives on the
*boundary* of AdS spacetime.

AdS/CFT is a gift that keeps on giving.
It helps us approach deep questions in quantum gravity, like: what
goes on inside a black hole? and what is spacetime anyway?
But as we twiddle knobs in the correspondence, we end up getting new
and surprising insights into *classical* gravity.
And because classical gravity calculations are easier than quantum ones, we can use AdS/CFT to sneakily do our
quantum mechanics homework!

AdS/CFT is still far from understood, with many active research frontiers.
At the moment, I'm interested in two related questions:
1. What can AdS/CFT tell us about black holes and physics behind the
   horizon?
2. What happens if we add boundaries to the quantum mechanical (CFT) system?

The first question is obviously interesting because black holes are cool and
weird and confusing.
The second question sounds technical, but turns out to be
related to the first: adding a boundary often provides simple, tractable models of
puzzling aspects of black hole physics.
So by answering the second question, we get technical tools which help
us learn more about the (obviously fun) second question!
