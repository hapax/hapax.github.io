### What do I do?

I study string theory and quantum gravity, with a particular focus
on the AdS/CFT correspondence.
This is the crazy-sounding proposition that
quantum gravity in (*d*+1)-dimensional, saddle-shaped space is exactly
equivalent to a regular quantum theory in *d* dimensions.
For instance, a 3D black hole can be simulated on a 2D quantum computer!

    width="55%" />

    computer.</i></figcaption>
	</div>

At the moment, I'm thinking about how to simulate black holes with
*half* a quantum computer.

#### Posters and talks

- [*Black holes and large c BCFTs*](assets/bcft2-poster.pdf) (2019). Poster for
  [Quantum Information and String Theory 2019](https://www2.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~qist2019/index.php),
  held at the
  [YITP](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/research/fields/research-institutes/yukawa-institute-for-theoretical-physics-yitp.html),
  Kyoto University, Japan.
- [*Boundary state black holes*](assets/melb-18-slides-short.pdf)
  (2018). Seminar delivered once to
  [particle theorists](http://www.coepp.org.au/), and again to
  [gravitational wavers](https://www.ozgrav.org/),
  at the University of Melbourne.

### Other technical notes and talks
- [*Chaos and thermalisation*](assets/chaos.pdf) (2018). In quantum
  mechanics, "chaotic" can mean either "looks random" or "spreads exponentially
  quickly". A talk on both notions, to the neutron star
  group at the University of Melbourne.
- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). In string
theory, loop diagrams are Riemann surfaces, leading to a beautiful
connection between scattering and geometry. Final project for a string
theory course.
- [*Unscrambling Hawking radiation*](assets/kitaev-yoshida.md)
  (2018). There is a (sort of) practical quantum algorithm for
  extracting information from a black hole. UBC strings group meeting on [Kitaev and Yoshida (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.03363.pdf).
- [*Safely falling into black holes*](assets/uncomplexity.md)
  (2017). Thinking of black holes as quantum computers, the
  remaining amount of useful computation equals the volume of "safe"
  spacetime left to jump into. UBC strings group presentation on [Zhao (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.03125.pdf).
- [*Inflation: inhomogeneities and spectra*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). Early quantum wrinkles equals
  late-time structure! Notes on inflation for a student seminar at the University of Melbourne.
