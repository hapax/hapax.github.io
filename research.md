I study quantum mechanics and gravity, with a particular focus on the
AdS/CFT correspondence.
At the moment, I'm interested in boundary conformal field theories,
the black hole information problem, Euclidean wormholes, and
statistical mechanics.
I list my papers and describe them briefly below, as well as assorted
technical notes.

#### Papers

1. [*BCFT entanglement entropy at large central charge and the black hole interior*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13088)
   (2020). [James Sully](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=author%3AJ.Sully.1%20AND%20collection%3Aciteable),
   [Mark Van Raamsdonk](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~mav/vanraamsdonk.html),
   David Wakeham. arXiv: 2004.13088.
   - From the CFT perspective, we prove that if you chop a holographic
   CFT in half, you sometimes cleanly slice the bulk. We give some
   precise sufficient conditions for this clean slicing (called the
   AdS/BCFT dictionary, and conjectured long ago) which as far as I
   know is a first. We also provide some neat applications to looking inside black holes!
2. [*Eigenstate thermalization and disorder averaging in gravity*](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.021601)
   (2020). [Jason Pollack](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~jpollack/),
   [Moshe Rozali](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~rozali/), James Sully,
   David Wakeham. PRL, 125:021601. arXiv:
   [2002.02971](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02971.pdf).
   - In a chaotic theory, averaging correlators of random states
   creates wormhole-like shortcuts between replicas of the
   theory. This applies to high energy states of a CFT and black
   holes, sure, but also your kettle or a molybdenum nucleus.
3. [*Brane dynamics from the first law of entanglement*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP03(2020)023.pdf)
  (2019). [Sean Cooper](https://seancooper.info/),
  [Dominik Neuenfeld](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=Dominik+Neuenfeld&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=&so=d&rm=&rg=25&sc=0),
 Moshe Rozali, David
  Wakeham. JHEP, 2020:23. arXiv:
  [1912.05746](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05746.pdf).
  - When the AdS/BCFT equivalence holds, the results of prodding
  the bulk slice should be compatible with the corresponding prodding
  of the boundary state in the CFT. We give a general recipe for
  learning bulk equations of motion from the compatibility
  requirement, and show the simplest version of AdS/BCFT obeys it.
4. [*Information radiation in BCFT models of black holes*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP05(2020)004.pdf)
  (2019). Moshe Rozali,
 James Sully,
 Mark Van Raamsdonk,
  [Christopher Waddell](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=a%20C.Waddell.2),
  David Wakeham. JHEP, 2020:4. arXiv:
  [1910.12836](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12836.pdf).
  - We cut holes in various theories which, by the magic of
    AdS/(B)CFT, are dual to evaporating black holes. These evaporating
    black holes help explain the "easy" version of 
5. [*Black hole microstate cosmology*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FJHEP07%282019%29065.pdf)
  (2018). Sean Cooper,
  Moshe Rozali,
  [Brian Swingle](https://sites.google.com/site/physicsmonkey/),
 Mark Van Raamsdonk,
  Christopher Waddell, David Wakeham. JHEP, 2019:65. arXiv:
  [1810.10601](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10601).
  - We cut holes in various theories which, by the magic of
    AdS/(B)CFT, are dual to black hole microstates. In turn, these
    microstates look like the Big Bang/Big Crunch FRW spacetimes
    relevant to cosmology!

#### Technical notes

- [*MIP\* = RE*](assets/mipre.pdf) (2020). Consulting entangled
  provers makes you a god. So says [this breakthough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383) in complexity
  theory. It also tells us something deep about the structure of entanglement and disproves a major
  conjecture in operator algebra theory. Notes for a group talk. <!--, showing that entangled provers can convince you of almost anything.-->
- [*Sphere packing and the modular bootstrap*](assets/sphere-packing.pdf)
  (2019). Surprisingly, throwing balls in a box can tell you about the
  lightest black holes in certain theories of quantum gravity. A group
  talk on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01319).
- [*Chaos and thermalisation*](assets/chaos.pdf) (2018). In quantum
  mechanics, "chaotic" can mean either "looks random" or "spreads exponentially
  quickly". A brief introduction to both notions.
- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). To paraphrase
Mark Kac, propagating string hear the shape of every Riemann
surface. I explain what this means in terms of the path integral and
moduli space of a string loop amplitude.
- [*The inflationary spectrum*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). If you want phenomenological
  constraints for your crazy pet GUT, you could do worse than go
  outside with a microwave camera and look at the night sky. Seminar
  talk on perturbations in cosmological inflation.
