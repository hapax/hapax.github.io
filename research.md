### What do I do?

Gravity describes large, heavy objects like planets, galaxies and black holes.
Quantum mechanics describes small, fuzzy things like electrons
orbiting the nucleus, or [cats trapped in radioactive boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat).
But if we add many of these small fuzzy things together, they must be
described by *both* gravity and quantum mechanics.
It turns out these theories are very hard to reconcile, and the
combined theory, *quantum gravity*, remains one of the holy grails of
theoretical physics.

We actually have a toy model of quantum gravity called the *AdS/CFT
correspondence*.
It tells us that quantum gravity in (*d+1*)-dimensions (AdS) can sometimes
be reduced quantum mechanics in *d* dimensions (CFT).
For instance, a 3D black hole can be run on a 2D quantum computer!

    computer.</i></figcaption>

Although it is much simple than our universe, AdS/CFT is a gift that
keeps on giving.
Often, we use it to learn about quantum gravity, asking questions
like: what goes on inside a black hole? how did the universe come into
being? and what is spacetime anyway?
Sometimes, we twiddle some knobs in the correspondence, and use it to
learn about *classical* gravity.
And finally, because it's easier to do calculations in classical
gravity than quantum mechanics, we can even use AdS/CFT to learn about
regular quantum mechanics!

But though it is the simplest setting for quantum gravity, AdS/CFT is
far from understood.
At the moment, there are two related questions I'm pursuing:
1. What can AdS/CFT tell us about black holes and physics behind the horizon?
2. What happens if we add boundaries to the quantum mechanical system
   used in the correspondence?
The first question is interesting because black holes are cool but
puzzling.
The second question may sound random, but turns out to be a simple

### Technical notes and talks
- [*Chaos and thermalisation*](assets/chaos.pdf) (2018). In quantum
  mechanics, "chaotic" can mean either "looks random" or "spreads exponentially
  quickly". A talk on both notions to the neutron star
  group at the University of Melbourne.
- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). In string
theory, loop diagrams are Riemann surfaces, leading to a beautiful
connection between scattering and geometry. Final project for a string
theory course.
- [*Inflation: inhomogeneities and spectra*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). Early quantum wrinkles equal
  late-time structure! Notes on inflation for a student seminar at the University of Melbourne.
