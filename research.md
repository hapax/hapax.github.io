### What do I do?

I study string theory and quantum gravity, with a particular focus
on the AdS/CFT correspondence.
This is the crazy-sounding (but extremely well-tested) proposition that
quantum gravity in (*d*+1)-dimensional, saddle-shaped space is exactly
equivalent to a regular quantum theory in *d* dimensions.
For instance, a 3D black hole can be simulated on a 2D quantum computer!

    computer.</i></figcaption>
	</figure>

At the moment, I'm thinking about what happens when you slice the
*d*-dimensional quantum theory in half.
It looks like this creates a wall or "brane" in the gravity theory,
and as you twiddle the boundary conditions of the cut in the quantum
theory, the brane will change position.
With some sleight of hand, we can insert these branes into *wormholes*, and use
half a quantum computer to describe the interior of a black hole!
