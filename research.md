### What do I do?

I work on string theory and quantum gravity, with a particular focus
on the AdS/CFT correspondence.
This is a remarkable hypothesis, using ideas from string theory, that
quantum gravity in (*d*+1)-dimensional, saddle-shaped space is exactly
equivalent to a regular quantum theory in *d* dimensions.
For instance, a 3D black hole can be described by a 2D
simulation on a quantum computer!

The *d*-dimensional quantum theories are called *conformal field
theories*, which roughly means they look the same when you zoom in
or out.
At the moment, I'm thinking about various aspects of *boundary
conformal field theories (BCFTs)*.
These are regular conformal field theories which have been sliced in
half.
It seems like the gravitation saddles they describe are also sliced in
half.
With some sleight of hand, we can slice a *wormhole* in half, and use
BCFTs to describe the inside of a black hole!
