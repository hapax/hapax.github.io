I study quantum mechanics and gravity, with a particular focus on the
AdS/CFT correspondence.
At the moment, I'm interested in boundary conformal field theories,
the black hole information problem, Euclidean wormholes, and
statistical mechanics.
You can find papers and brief descriptions below, as well as assorted technical notes.

#### Papers

1. [*BCFT entanglement entropy at large central charge and the black hole interior*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13088)
   (2020). [James Sully](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=author%3AJ.Sully.1%20AND%20collection%3Aciteable),
   [Mark Van Raamsdonk](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~mav/vanraamsdonk.html),
   David Wakeham. arXiv: 2004.13088.
   - From the CFT perspective, we prove that if you chop a holographic
   CFT_2 in half, you sometimes cleanly slice the bulk. We give
   precise sufficient conditions for this clean slicing (called the
   AdS/BCFT dictionary, and conjectured long ago) but as far as I
   know, stating conditions like this is a first. We also provide
   neat applications to looking inside black holes, proving some results in [4] and [5] microscopically.
2. [*Eigenstate thermalization and disorder averaging in gravity*](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.021601)
   (2020). [Jason Pollack](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~jpollack/),
   [Moshe Rozali](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~rozali/), James Sully,
   David Wakeham. PRL, 125:021601. arXiv:
   [2002.02971](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02971.pdf).
   - In a chaotic theory, averaging correlators of random states
   creates wormhole-like shortcuts between replicas of the
   theory. This applies to high energy states of a CFT and black
   holes, sure, but also your kettle or a molybdenum nucleus.
3. [*Brane dynamics from the first law of entanglement*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP03(2020)023.pdf)
  (2019). [Sean Cooper](https://seancooper.info/),
  [Dominik Neuenfeld](http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=Dominik+Neuenfeld&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=&so=d&rm=&rg=25&sc=0),
 Moshe Rozali, David
  Wakeham. JHEP, 2020:23. arXiv:
  [1912.05746](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05746.pdf).
  - When the AdS/BCFT equivalence holds, the results of prodding
  the bulk slice should be compatible with the corresponding prodding
  in the CFT. We give a general recipe for learning bulk equations of
  motion from this compatibility requirement, and show the simplest
  version of AdS/BCFT obeys it.
4. [*Information radiation in BCFT models of black holes*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP05(2020)004.pdf)
  (2019). Moshe Rozali,
 James Sully,
 Mark Van Raamsdonk,
  [Christopher Waddell](https://inspirehep.net/literature?sort=mostrecent&size=25&page=1&q=a%20C.Waddell.2),
  David Wakeham. JHEP, 2020:4. arXiv:
  [1910.12836](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12836.pdf).
  - We cut holes in various theories which, by the magic of
    AdS/(B)CFT, are dual to evaporating black holes. These configurations
    shed light (or rather Hawking radiation) on the black hole
    information problem.
5. [*Black hole microstate cosmology*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FJHEP07%282019%29065.pdf)
  (2018). Sean Cooper,
  Moshe Rozali,
  [Brian Swingle](https://sites.google.com/site/physicsmonkey/),
 Mark Van Raamsdonk,
  Christopher Waddell, David Wakeham. JHEP, 2019:65. arXiv:
  [1810.10601](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10601).
  - We cut holes in various theories which, by the magic of
    AdS/(B)CFT, are dual to black hole microstates. These microstates
    look like the Big Bang/Big Crunch FRW spacetimes relevant to
    cosmology, so perhaps we live on an end-of-the-world brane behind
    a black hole horizon! Probably not, but it makes for good dinner
    party conversation.

#### Technical notes

- [*MIP\* = RE*](assets/mipre.pdf) (2020). Consulting entangled
  provers makes you a god. Although this is [a (big) result](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383) in complexity
  theory, it also tells us something deep about the structure of entanglement and disproves a major
  conjecture in operator algebra theory. Notes for a group talk. <!--, showing that entangled provers can convince you of almost anything.-->
- [*Sphere packing and the modular bootstrap*](assets/sphere-packing.pdf)
  (2019). Surprisingly, throwing balls in a box can tell you about the
  lightest black holes in certain theories of quantum gravity. A group
  talk on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01319).
- [*Chaos and thermalisation*](assets/chaos.pdf) (2018). In quantum
  mechanics, "chaotic" can mean either "looks random" or "spreads exponentially
  quickly". A brief introduction to both notions.
- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). To paraphrase
Mark Kac, propagating strings hear the shape of every Riemann
surface. I explain what this means in terms of the path integral and
moduli space of a string loop amplitude.
- [*The inflationary spectrum*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). If you want phenomenological
  constraints for your crazy pet GUT, you could do worse than go
  outside with a microwave camera and look at the night sky. Seminar
  talk on perturbations in cosmological inflation.
