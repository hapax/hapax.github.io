I study quantum mechanics and gravity, with a particular focus on the
AdS/CFT correspondence.
At the moment, I'm interested in boundary conformal field theories,
the black hole information problem, Euclidean wormholes, and
statistical mechanics.

#### Papers

1. [*BCFT entanglement entropy at large central charge and the black hole interior*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13088)
   (2020). [James Sully](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=author%3AJ.Sully.1%20AND%20collection%3Aciteable),
   [Mark Van Raamsdonk](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~mav/vanraamsdonk.html),
   David Wakeham. arXiv: 2004.13088. We show that if you chop a
   holographic CFT in half, you sometimes cleanly slice the bulk. This
   has some neat applications to looking inside black holes!
2. [*Eigenstate thermalization and disorder averaging in gravity*](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.021601)
   (2020). [Jason Pollack](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~jpollack/),
   [Moshe Rozali](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/~rozali/), James Sully,
   David Wakeham. PRL, 125:021601. arXiv:
   [2002.02971](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02971.pdf). In a chaotic
   theory, correlators for random states can be described by
   wormhole-like shortcuts between replicas of the theory.
3. [*Brane dynamics from the first law of entanglement*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP03(2020)023.pdf)
  (2019). [Sean Cooper](https://seancooper.info/),

 Moshe Rozali, David
  Wakeham. JHEP, 2020:23. arXiv: [1912.05746](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05746.pdf).
4. [*Information radiation in BCFT models of black holes*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/JHEP05(2020)004.pdf)
  (2019). Moshe Rozali,

5. [*Black hole microstate cosmology*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FJHEP07%282019%29065.pdf)
  (2018). Sean Cooper,

#### Technical notes

- [*MIP\* = RE*](assets/mipre.pdf) (2020). Consulting entangled
  provers makes you a god. This
  [breakthough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383) in complexity theory
  also tells us something deep about the structure of entanglement and disproves a major
  conjecture in operator algebra theory. Notes for a group talk. <!--, showing that entangled provers can convince you of almost anything.-->
- [*Sphere packing and the modular bootstrap*](assets/sphere-packing.pdf)
  (2019). Surprisingly, throwing balls in a box can tell you about the
  lightest black holes in certain theories of quantum gravity. A group
  talk on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01319).
- [*Chaos and thermalisation*](assets/chaos.pdf) (2018). In quantum
  mechanics, "chaotic" can mean either "looks random" or "spreads exponentially
  quickly". A brief introduction to both notions.
- [*String perturbation theory and Riemann surfaces*]({{
hapax.github.io }}/assets/strings-project.pdf) (2018). To paraphrase
Mark Kac, propagating strings hear the shape of a Riemann surface. I
explain what this means in terms of path integrals and moduli space
of vacuum loop amplitudes.
- [*The inflationary spectrum*]({{ hapax.github.io
  }}/assets/inflation-notes.pdf) (2016). If you want phenomenological
  constraints for your crazy pet GUT, you could do worse than go
  outside with a microwave camera and look at the night sky. Seminar
  talk on perturbations in cosmological inflation.
