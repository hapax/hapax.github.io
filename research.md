### What do I do?

Gravity describes large, heavy objects like planets, galaxies and black holes.
Quantum mechanics describes small, fuzzy things like electrons
orbiting the nucleus, or [cats trapped in radioactive boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat).
But if we add many of these small fuzzy things together, they must be
described by *both* gravity and quantum mechanics.
It turns out these theories are very hard to reconcile, and the
combined theory, *quantum gravity*, remains one of the holy grails of
theoretical physics.

Although quantum gravity in full generality is still very hard and mysterious,
we have a simple, somewhat miraculous example called the *AdS/CFT
correspondence*.
It tells us that quantum gravity in a special (*d+1*)-dimensional
spacetime (AdS) is exactly equivalent to quantum mechanics in *d* dimensions (CFT).
For instance, a 3D black hole can be run on a 2D quantum computer!
Although this strange difference in dimension is expected as a general feature of quantum gravity,
in AdS/CFT it is realised in a simple and beautiful way: the quantum
mechanical system lives on the *boundary* of spacetime.

AdS/CFT is a gift that keeps on giving.
It helps us approach deep questions in quantum gravity, like: what
goes on inside a black hole? and what is spacetime anyway?
But as we twiddle knobs in the correspondence, we end up getting new
and surprising insights into *classical* gravity.
And because it's easier to do calculations in classical
gravity than quantum mechanics, we can use AdS/CFT to sneakily do our
quantum homework!

AdS/CFT is still far from understood.
At the moment, I'm focused on two related questions:
1. What can AdS/CFT tell us about black holes and physics behind the
   horizon?
2. What happens if we add boundaries to the quantum mechanical system?

The first question is obviously interesting; black holes are cool and
super weird.
While the second question sounds technical, it turns out to be
related: adding a boundary can provides simple, tractable models of
puzzling aspects of black hole physics.
So by answering the second question, we get technical tools which help
us with the first!
