### Nontechnical overview

I study quantum gravity.
Loosely speaking, this is the theory needed to
describe what happens when you throw
Schrödinger's cat into a black hole. Although quantum gravity is poorly understood in
general, in one setting we have made impressive progress: quantum
gravity *in a box*.

So, suppose I give you a box with a little universe inside.
This little universe is governed by gravity, a geometric theory
where objects can stretch, curve and collapse into black holes.
20 years ago, physicists discovered a miracle: quantum gravity inside the box
is encoded in ordinary quantum physics on the surface.
This is a bit like a hologram, where we can "see" a three-dimensional
image emerging from a two-dimensional surface, so the relationship between
inside and outside is called the *holographic correspondence*.

Let's return to the unethical experiment proposed above, where we drop
Schrödinger's cat into a black hole.
Do we understand what happens in the simplest quantum gravity setting,
when the black hole is inside the box?
Well, not exactly, but a remarkable simplification occurs: using the
holographic correspondence, the black hole can be understood as a
special type of *quantum computer*, and dropping the cat becomes an
information processing task.
So we can study quantum gravity by learning more about quantum
computers!

group is affiliated with the Simons Foundation
[It From Qubit](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/mathematics-physical-sciences/it-from-qubit/)
collaboration, an international network of researchers using tools
from quantum information theory to study quantum gravity (and sometimes vice versa).
