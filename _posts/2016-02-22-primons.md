**February 22, 2016**. *Primons are fictitious particles connected to
  prime numbers. We see how their statistical-mechanical properties are related to results in number theory via supersymmetry.*

## Introduction

*Prerequisites: basic theory of the Riemann zeta, the Möbius
function, quantum statistical mechanics.* 

In recent years, some interesting connections between number theory
and physics have come to light. The *Riemann zeta function* provides a
nice example. Recall that, for $\Re(s) > 1$,


$$ 
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}. 
$$
 
The last form is called the *Euler product*, and relates the Riemann zeta to prime numbers.

We'll see a way to view the Riemann zeta in terms of statistical mechanics, and turning things around, use supersymmetry to think about a related number-theoretic object called the *Möbius function*. 

## Bosons
 
To begin with, imagine we have a gas of non-interacting bosonic "primons", with energy levels

$$ 
\epsilon_n = \epsilon \ln(p_n), \quad n \in \mathbb{N}. 
$$
 
Here, $p_n$ denotes the $n$th prime. In Fock space, we can encode the occupation numbers for each energy level in the prime factors of a single integer $m$, 

$$ 
m = p_1^{d_1}\cdots p_k^{d_k} 
$$
 
with $d_k$ the occupation number of energy level $k$. (This neat trick
is due to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering">Gödel</a>,
who used it in his proof of the first incompleteness theorem.) For the
state $|m\rangle$, the total energy (since primons are
non-interacting) is 

$$ 
E_m = \epsilon \sum_{i=1}^k d_i\ln(p_i) = \epsilon \ln m. 
$$
 
Thus, for $\epsilon > kT = \beta^{-1}$, in the canonical ensemble we have 

$$ 
Z_B[\beta] = \sum_{m \geq 1} e^{-E_m \beta} = \sum_{m \geq 1} \frac{1}{m^{\epsilon \beta}} = \zeta(\epsilon \beta). 
$$
 
Let's calculate the energy. First, note that from the Euler product representation, 

$$ 
\ln\zeta(s) = -\sum_{p} \ln(1 - p^{-s}). 
$$
 
Recalling that $\langle E \rangle = -\partial_\beta \ln Z_B[\beta]$, we have 

$$ 
\langle E \rangle = -\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\ln \zeta(\epsilon\beta) = \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta}\sum_{p} \ln(1 - p^{-\epsilon \beta}) = \sum_{n\geq 1} \frac{\epsilon_n}{p_n^{\epsilon \beta} - 1}. 
$$
 
So, the expected occupancy at level $n$ is $(e^{\epsilon_n \beta} -
1)^{-1}$, a Bose-Einstein distribution. As $s = \epsilon \beta \to
1^+$, there is the familiar $s = 1$ singularity of the zeta function,
and the energy blows up. The temperature $T = \epsilon/k$ is called
the *Hagedorn temperature*, and represents a phase transition. (You
would expect to use the analytic continuation of the zeta function on
the other side of the singularity. Apparently you run into
difficulties, but I haven't investigated.) 
 
## Fermions
 
We can do the same thing for fermionic primons, taking the Pauli exclusion principle into account. This means the $n$th occupation number $d_n \in \{0,1\}$, and hence, each Fock space state is represented by a *square-free natural number* in Gödel numbering. As before, for a square-free integer $m$, $E_m = \epsilon \ln m$, but now the partition function is harder to calculate. Let's use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_function">Möbius function</a> $\mu(n)$, defined by 

$$ 
\mu(m) = \begin{cases} (-1)^k & \text{$m = p_1\cdots p_k$ is square free} \\ 0 & \text{else}.\end{cases} 
$$
 
By reciprocating the Euler product, it's easy to show that 

$$ 
\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}=\prod_{p}\left(1-p^{-s}\right)=\sum_{m\geq 1} \frac{\mu(m)}{m^s}. 
$$
 
Moreover, 

$$ 
\frac{\zeta(s)}{\zeta(2s)} = \prod_{p}\frac{1-p^{-2s}}{1-p^{-s}} = \prod_{p}\left(1+p^{-s}\right)=\sum_{m\geq 1} \frac{|\mu(m)|}{m^s}. 
$$
 
Finally, we can evaluate the fermionic partition function: 

$$ 
Z_F[\beta] = \sum_{m \geq 1} |\mu(m)|e^{-E_m \beta} = \sum_{m \geq 1} \frac{|\mu(m)|}{m^{\beta\epsilon}} = \frac{\zeta(\beta\epsilon)}{\zeta(2\beta\epsilon)}. 
$$
 
Since $\ln Z_F[\beta] = \ln \zeta(\beta\epsilon) - \ln\zeta(2\beta\epsilon)$, our calculations for the bosonic case show that, for fermions, 

$$ 
\langle E \rangle = \sum_{n\geq 1} \left[\frac{\epsilon_n}{p_n^{\epsilon \beta} - 1}-\frac{2\epsilon_n}{p_n^{2\epsilon \beta} - 1}\right] = \sum_{n\geq 1} \frac{\epsilon_n}{e^{\epsilon_n \beta} + 1}, 
$$
 
again, the right occupancy for a Fermi gas. In fact, we could turn
things around: from the Fermi distribution, it follows that

$$
\sum_{m\geq 1} |\mu(m)|m^{-s} = \zeta(s)/\zeta(2s)
$$

without having to
use the Euler product!
Also, we should note that since $\zeta$ has a simple pole singularity as $s = 1$, naively taking the limit in the result above gives 

$$ 
\sum_{m\geq 1} \frac{\mu(m)}{m} = 0. 
$$
 
In fact, it's clear that if the series converges, it must vanish, and showing it converges is straightforward. Remarkably, this turns out to be equivalent to the celebrated Prime Number Theorem! 

$$ 
\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}. 
$$

## Supersymmetry
 
Let's explore the role of the Möbius function a bit more. We set up a
*supersymmetric* quantum field theory, which can create boson primons
with $b_n^\dagger$ and fermion primons with $f_n^\dagger$. For states
with nonzero energy, these are interchanged by a *supercharge* $Q$. We
can label Fock states as $|m_B, m_F\rangle \equiv |m_B\rangle \otimes
|m_B\rangle$, tensoring the bosons and fermion spaces together. 
 
It's useful to define the operator $(-1)^F$, where $F$ is the number of fermions in a Fock state. The *Witten index* $\Delta$ for the theory is the number of bosonic zero energy states minus the number of fermionic zero energy states. Since bosonic and fermionic contributions cancel out for nonzero energy, $\Delta$ is computed by 

$$ 
\Delta = \mbox{tr} [(-1)^F e^{-\beta H}]. 
$$
 
Denote $m \equiv m_Bm_F$. Let's calculate $\Delta$ for our
supersymmetric primon gas:

$$
\begin{align*} 
\Delta & = \mbox{tr} [(-1)^F e^{-\beta H}] \\ 
& = \sum_{m_B, m_F}\mbox{tr} [(-1)^F e^{-\beta H}|m_B, m_F\rangle\langle m_B, m_F|]\\ 
& = \sum_{m_B, m_F}e^{-\beta E_m}\langle m_B, m_F|(-1)^F|m_B, m_F\rangle\\ 
& = \sum_{m\geq 1}\frac{1}{m^{\beta\epsilon}}\sum_{m_F|m}\mu(m_F). 
\end{align*}
$$

On the fourth line, something very important happened: we replaced the expectation of $(-1)^F$ by the Möbius function acting on $m_F$, since the contribution vanishes unless the state's Gödel number is square-free, and if it is square free, $(-1)^F = \mu(m_F)$. 
 
To proceed further we can use either physics or number theory. Using properties of the Möbius function, we see that the last sum over $m_F$ vanishes for $m > 1$ and equals $1$ for $m = 1$. Explicitly, 

$$ 
\sum_{d|m}\mu(d) = \begin{cases}0 & m>1 \\ 1 & m = 1.\end{cases} 
$$
 
Hence, 

$$ 
\Delta = e^{-\beta E_1} = 1. 
$$
 
If you know about the Witten index, you can go the other way and read
these fundamental identities for $\mu$ off the physics! For instance,
accepting that $\Delta$ is an invariant and requiring $\beta$
independence forces $\sum_{d|m}\mu(d) = 0$ for $m > 1$. The remaining
identity for $\mu(m)$ follows provided $\Delta = 1$. We can see this
directly, since the unique vacuum state has Gödel number $m =1$ and is
bosonic (it contains no fermions).

The basic moral is that physical intuition is a great labour-saving
device.
Of course, it comes at the cost of rigour, but what
distinguishes a theoretical physicist from a mathematical physicist is
that this seems like a good trade!

For more details on this argument and other results of a similar
nature, see Spector (1990). For more on primon gases and the physics
of the Riemann zeta function, see Schumayer and Hutchinson (2011).
