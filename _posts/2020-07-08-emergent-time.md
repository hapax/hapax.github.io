**July 8, 2020.** *Why can we remember the past but not the future? I
  discuss how folk metaphysics draws attention to genuine puzzles
  about the nature of time, and outline some desiderata for a
  satisfying physical explanation.*

#### Brain states and metaphysics

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I discussed *presentism*, the view that only the present exists.
I argued that, though compelling at the level of folk psychology,
presentism is ultimately unable to explain change, and our sense data
are telling us about brain states rather than metaphysics.
But perhaps this is a bit too quick.
Our brain states might tell us something deep about the
universe after all.
In particular, it seems odd that we can remember the past but not the future.
As Terry Pratchett puts it in *Reaper Man*:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Alone of all the creatures in the world, trolls believe that all
living things go through Time backwards. 'If the past is visible and
the future is hidden,' they say, 'then it means you must be facing the
wrong way.'
</span>

Why do we face one way and not the other?

At the level of folk epistemology, being lodged in the present
moment gives rise to presentism, and being "uninfluenced" by future
events gives rise to the doctrine of free will, and the appeal of
"growing block" ontologies for spacetime, where the future does not
yet exist.
I think none of these conclusions is licensed by the properties of our brain states.
But being lodged in the present seems like a trivially explicable
thing, while only being able to remember the past is not.

#### Temporal solipsism

Let's pause for a moment and untangle a common thread winding through these
ideas.
Presentism, free will, and growing blocks all represent a
type of *solipsism*.
A solipsist proper treats the fact that they cannot experience other
minds as conclusive evidence that other minds do not exist.
A presentist treats the fact that they only experience the
present as evidence only the present exists.
Similarly, an enthusiast of growing blocks or free will imagines that
future events (or future decisions) do not exist since they have yet to
encounter (or make) them.
To be sure, a growing blocker is more liberal than a presentist, since
they believe in the past, but this is like a "friendly" solipsist who
believe only in the existence of the people they have met.

Solipsism would not be crazy if you were the only sentient being in a
world of amoebae.
You would not need a theory of mind to explain their behaviour.
But in a world of beings whose behavioural complexity matches your own,
mental states you cannot access remain the best explanation for the
behaviour of others.
Solipsists may be good Cartesians, retaining only those ontological
commitments that might not be spoofed by a malicious Cartesian demon,
but they are terrible scientists.
They can explain nothing!
I think the appeal of solipsism is not that it is explanatory, but
that it is all that survives the scorched-earth epistemic program of
Cartesian doubt.

Temporally speaking, we do not live in a universe of amoebae.
We live in a spacetime continuum where different temporal slices obey
the same laws of physics, namely the laws of general relativity (at
large scales).
As with human behaviour, these slices *look the same from the
outside*.
A paranoid Cartesian might say: things look different from in here, so
they are different out there.
A realist replies: they look the same from the outside, and the best
explanation is that they look the same from the inside too.
But like a context-dependent joke, to see the inside, I guess you need
to be there.

#### Thisness and thatness

Let's return to our original question, namely, to what extent brain
states license metaphysical conclusions.
Solipsists and presentists notice that there is a quiddity, a
*thisness*, to being in a mind and being in a moment.
But from "thisness", they leap to the remarkable inference that
"thatness" is the same as non-existence!
A growing blocker or free willer is, I think, fundamentally making the
same inference, but they are prepared to treat the chains of causation
binding the past to the present as a certificate of existence.
To me, these conclusions make no sense, and almost deliberately
non-explanatory.

But the fact there is a "thisness" at all is apparently a
metaphysical fact.
The quiddity of having a mind is the experience of mental sensations,
also called *qualia*. 
These qualia seem undeniable, though efforts to explain them away, or
comfortably ensconce them in a physicalist framework, are heroic and
often amusing.
I would be very surprised if someone could one day extract my
subjective experience of the colour red from the standard model
Lagrangian, but good luck to them.

In the temporal case, the quiddity of being lodged in the present
moment is trivially explicable: the "thisness" of the present and
"thatness" of the future and past are indexicals in the same spirit as
"hereness" and "thereness".
(See the
[prequel](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/)
for more details.) 
But while the spirit is similar, there is an asymmetry between future
and past which does not exist between up and down.
This asymmetry is what gives free will and the growing block their
folk appeal.
And that is really the point I want to make: while the folk Cartesian
may draw the wrong conclusions, the *premises are sound*.
There is something strange about being in a mind.
There is something strange about being in time.

#### The bow and the arrow

The problem can be clearly stated as follows: *why change*?
The presentist or blocker might answer: because existence.
In other words, what exists is changing, so of course we see change.
If we dismiss this as temporal solipsism, and adopt an even-handed
four-dimensionalist ontology, the question becomes: *why cause and
effect*?
Put differently, why can we remember the past but not the future?

At this point, physicists will give a range of answers.
The relativist says: because spacetime signature.
This is evidently so, but it does not explain the asymmetry between
time and space, but simply bakes it into the geometry.
The statistical mechanic says: because entropy.
But even this makes no sense unless you have some way for a system to
change so as to explore phase space.
In other words, you still need a *microscopic* arrow of time.
So the question becomes: what is the bow that launches this
microscopic arrow?

#### Emergent time

(This section is mildly technical.)
A satisfying answer, to my mind, would be along the
following lines.
Start off with some highly symmetric mathematical object $\mathcal{M}$
which does not possess any notion of time.
Introduce patterns or structures or fields, collectively labelled
$\Psi$, and some laws $L$ governing, perhaps written as $L(\Psi) = 0$.
These laws $L$ should not make any reference to time.
Finally, there might be boundary conditions for $\Psi$ on
$\partial\mathcal{M}$, which once again should know nothing about time.
Here, $\mathcal{M}$ might be something rather
different from a manifold, and $\partial$ something rather different
from a boundary operator. I am being schematic.

I would say this theory provides an *emergent theory of time* if
the solutions $L(\Psi) = 0$ spontaneously break some symmetry of both
$L$ and $\mathcal{M}$, and develop "timelike defects" along which
correlations are organized asymmetrically.
These could perhaps be described an emergent Lorentzian metric $g$,
perhaps included in, or built from, the fields $\Phi$ on $\mathcal{M}$.

Now, all this sounds very vague, but is similar in spirit to what
[Hartle and Hawking (1983)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.28.2960)
attempted with their "no-boundary" proposal.
They wanted to describe the quantum-mechanical wavefunction $\Psi$ of
the *whole universe*, using something called the Wheeler-de Witt
equation, which makes no reference to time.
Their boundary condition was that there was no boundary!
I'm not sure their proposal satisfies my wishlist, but I might write
about the paper in more detail some time, partly to motivate myself to
understand it better.

#### Conclusion

Presentists, growing blockers, and other temporal solipsists are
probably wrong about ontology, but right about epistemology: there is
something strange about time.
The usual physical explanations usually *presuppose* a distinguished
timelike direction.
Really, the only satisfying explanation, from a four-dimensionalist
perspective, would be to define physical laws which know nothing about
time, on a mathematical space which knows nothing about time, and have
time --- i.e. one-dimensional defects with highly constrained
correlations --- emerge via spontaneously broken symmetry.
Maybe Hawking and Hartle have the right idea.

But it's amusing to note that dubious, folk Cartesian metaphysical
claims, might, if suitably interpreted, give us clues about
fundamental theories of emergent time.
