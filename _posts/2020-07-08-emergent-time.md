**July 8, 2020.** *Why can we remember the past but not the future?
  And why do objects persist? I discuss how folk metaphysics draws attention to genuine puzzles
  about the nature of time, and outline some desiderata for a
  satisfactory physical explanation.*

#### Brain states and metaphysics

In a
[previous post](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/),
I discussed *presentism*, the view that only the present exists.
I argued that, though compelling at the level of folk psychology,
presentism is ultimately unable to explain change, and our sense data
are telling us about brain states rather than metaphysics.
But perhaps this is a bit too quick.
Our brain states might tell us something deep about the
universe after all!
In particular, it seems odd that we can remember the past but not the future.
As Terry Pratchett puts it in *Reaper Man*:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
Alone of all the creatures in the world, trolls believe that all
living things go through Time backwards. 'If the past is visible and
the future is hidden,' they say, 'then it means you must be facing the
wrong way.'
</span>

Why do we face the wrong way?

At the level of folk epistemology, being lodged in the present
moment gives rise to presentism, and being "uninfluenced" by future
events gives rise to the doctrine of free will. At a less folky level,
it explains the appeal of "growing block" ontologies for spacetime, where the future does not
yet exist.
I think none of these conclusions is licensed by the properties of our brain states.
But being lodged in the present seems like a trivially explicable
thing, while our inability to remember the future is not.
This is related to an even deeper puzzle, namely that objects
*persist*, which we will elaborate below.

#### Temporal solipsism

Let's pause for a moment and untangle a common thread winding through these
ideas.
Presentism, free will, and growing blocks all represent a
type of *solipsism*.
A solipsist proper treats the fact that they cannot experience other
minds as conclusive evidence that other minds do not exist.
A presentist treats the fact that they only experience the
present moment as evidence only this moment exists.
Similarly, an enthusiast of growing blocks or free will imagines that
future events (or future decisions) do not exist since they have yet to
encounter (or make) them.
To be sure, a blocker is more liberal than a presentist, since
they believe in the past, but this is like a "friendly" solipsist who
believes only in the existence of the people they have met.

Solipsism would not be crazy if you were the only sentient being in a
world of amoebae, since you would not need a theory of mind to explain their behaviour.
But in a world of beings whose behavioural complexity matches your own,
mental states you cannot access remain the best explanation for the
behaviour of others.
Solipsists may be good Cartesians, retaining only those ontological
commitments that cannot be spoofed by a malicious Cartesian demon,
but they are terrible scientists.
They can explain nothing!
I think the appeal of solipsism is not that it is explanatory, but
that it survives the scorched-earth epistemic program of
Cartesian doubt.

Temporally speaking, we do not live in a universe of amoebae.
We live in a spacetime continuum where different temporal slices
richly obey
the same laws of physics, namely, Einstein's general relativity, at
least at large enough scales.
As with human behaviour, these slices *look the same from the
outside*.
A paranoid Cartesian might say: things look different from in here, so
they are different out there.
A realist replies: they look the same from the outside, and the best
explanation is that they look the same from the inside too.
But like certain jokes, to see the inside, I guess you need
to be there.

#### Thisness and thatness

Let's return to our original question, namely, to what extent brain
states license metaphysical conclusions.
Solipsists and presentists notice that there is a quiddity, a
*thisness*, to being in a mind and being in a moment.
But from "thisness", they leap to the remarkable inference that
"thatness" is the same as non-existence!
A growing blocker or free willer is, I think, fundamentally making the
same inference, but they are prepared to let existence spread like a
contaminant from present effects to their causes.

To me, these conclusions make no sense, and are almost deliberately
non-explanatory.
But the fact there is a "thisness" at all is unavoidable.
For instance, the quiddity of having a mind is the experience of mental sensations,
also called *qualia*. 
I don't think it's plausible to deny qualia, though efforts to explain
them away, or comfortably ensconce them in a physicalist framework,
are heroic and often amusing.
I would be very surprised if someone could one day extract my
subjective experience of the colour red from the standard model
Lagrangian, but good luck to them all the same.

In the temporal case, the quiddity of being lodged in the present
moment is trivially explicable: the "thisness" of the present and
"thatness" of the future and past are indexicals in the same spirit as
"hereness" and "thereness".
(See the
[prequel](https://hapax.github.io/philosophy/physics/psychology-time/)
for more details.) 
But while the spirit is similar, there is an asymmetry between future
and past which does not exist between up and down, or left and right.
This asymmetry is what makes free will and the growing block plausible.
And that is really the point I want to make: while the folk Cartesian
may draw the wrong conclusions, the *premises are sound*.
There is something strange about being in a mind.
There is something strange about being in time.

#### The bow and the arrow

The problem can be clearly stated as follows: *why change*?
The presentist or blocker might answer: *because existence*.
In other words, what exists is changing, and changes become in the world.
If we dismiss this as temporal solipsism, and adopt an even-handed
four-dimensionalist ontology, the question becomes: *why cause and
effect*?
Put differently, why can we remember the past but not the future?

At this point, physicists step in and claim to offer a solution.
The relativist says: *because spacetime signature*.
In other words, the spacetime manifold comes equipped with a timelike
direction, locally, everywhere.
This is evidently so, but it does not explain the asymmetry between
time and space; it simply bakes it into the geometry.
Is there a more fundamental way of explaining the asymmetry?
The statistical mechanic says: *because entropy*.
Roughly speaking, a system with many parts changes in an effectively
random way, and it will tend towards the most likely outcomes,
particularly when the odds for the unlikely outcomes are $p \sim 10^{-23}$.
The second law of thermodynamics states that these odds are
well-approximated by zero.

The claim is that the irreversible, macroscopic arrow of time arises
from a system exploring ways to be.
Let's examine this claim a little more closely.
The *entropy* is just the logarithm of the number of ways the system
can be while looking the same at a macroscopic level, $S = \log N$.
There can be some maximally likely way for a system to be, which
corresponds to maximum entropy, $S_\text{max}$.
But if the universe (or a box of gas, or a shiny
new pair of sneakers, or whatever) is for some reason in a
sub-maximal, or *low entropy state (LES)*, then it
will explore ways to be in an effectively irreversible
fashion, even though the laws of physics *are* reversible.
Although the universe might not know about cause and effect at a
fundamental level, it would be foolish to bet against them.
In the language of physics, the LES "spontaneously
breaks" the invariance of the laws of physics under time translation.
The laws may not change with time, but the objects do, and cause and
effect are born.

This point of view has a curious consequence, and a curious
premise, neither of which is usually stated.
The odd consequence is that if I have an LES, then causes should flow away from that event *in both
directions*.
Time not only has a translation symmetry, but a *reflection symmetry*,
and the residuum after introducing the LES is reflection
around this special point in time when it occurs.
In the same fashion, the residuum of time translation symmetry is that
the LES can occur at *any* point in time.
(Technically, if the symmetry group is $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{Z}_2$,
we simply break it to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ with a real line's worth of
"degenerate" places to put the LES.)
In a sense, the LES is a bow which launches the arrow of time, but in
fact it launches *two* arrows, one in either direction.

The curious premise is actually very subtle.
Essentially, it is the notion that *objects persist*.
In other words, slightly different copies of the system are arranged
along some special dimension, and there is enough correlation between
these copies that they can explore phase space.
These are evidently very different, and much stronger, than the
correlations that exist between physical objects along the spatial
dimensions.
So, the question "why change" becomes: *why persistence?*
<!-- a *microscopic* arrow of time to
explain the macroscopic arrow.
So the question becomes: what is the bow that launches this
microscopic arrow? -->

#### Emergent time

(This section is mildly technical.)
What would a satisfying answer look like?
Here are a few preliminary thoughts.
Start off with some highly symmetric mathematical object $\mathcal{M}$
which does not possess any notion of time.
Introduce patterns or structures or fields, collectively labelled
$\Psi$, and some laws $L$ governing them, perhaps written as $L(\Psi) = 0$.
These laws $L$ should not make any reference to time.
Finally, there might be boundary conditions for $\Psi$ on
$\partial\mathcal{M}$, which once again should know nothing about time.
Here, $\mathcal{M}$ might be something rather
different from a manifold, and $\partial$ something rather different
from a boundary operator. I am being schematic.

I would say this theory provides an *emergent theory of time* if
the solutions $L(\Psi) = 0$ spontaneously break some symmetry of both
$L$ and $\mathcal{M}$, and develop one-dimensional "timelike defects"
along which correlations between local values $\Psi$ are
parametrically stronger.
These strong, unidimensional correlations would be *persisting objects*.
To get an arrow of time, entropy perhaps is the key, and one could
get phase space by taking slices transverse to
this one-dimensional defect, i.e. time slices of the persisting
objects.
<!-- correlations are organized asymmetrically.-->
Ideally, these should be described by some emergent Lorentzian
metric, but just figuring out why objects persist would be important
progress in my books.

All this sounds very vague, but turns out to be similar in spirit to what
[Hartle and Hawking (1983)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.28.2960)
attempt with their "no-boundary" proposal.
Their boundary condition is that there is no boundary!
They wanted to describe the quantum-mechanical wavefunction $\Psi$ of
the *whole universe*, using something called the Wheeler-de Witt
equation, which makes no reference to time.
I'm not sure their proposal satisfies all the points on my wishlist,
but I will set myself the homework of working through the details.
(In fairness to Hawking, he was motivated by a different temporal problem,
namely the awkwardness of an initial singularity, aka the Big Bang, in our description of the universe.)

#### Conclusion

Presentists, growing blockers, and other temporal solipsists are
probably wrong about ontology, but right about epistemology: there is
something strange about time.
The usual physical explanations *presuppose* change along a distinguished
timelike direction.
Really, the only satisfying explanation, from a four-dimensionalist
perspective, would be to define physical laws which know nothing about
time, on a mathematical space which knows nothing about time, and have
time --- i.e. one-dimensional defects with highly constrained
correlations --- emerge via spontaneously broken symmetry.
Maybe Hawking and Hartle have the right idea.
But it's amusing that the collision between folk metaphysics and
four-dimensionalism might, if approached with suitable humility, give us clues
about fundamental theories of physics.
