**December 27, 2020.** *If you have a jumbled pile of socks,
  how many do you need to draw on average before getting a pair? The
  answer turns out to be surprisingly tricky!*

#### Searching for socks

After a load of washing, I sometimes get lazy and throw unpaired socks
into a draw.
Later, I will simply withdraw socks at random until I get a pair.
Faced with this dilemma, I wondered: for $n$ pairs, what is the
average number of draws required to get a pair?
This simple question turns out to be surprisingly tricky to answer!

To start with, we can calculate the probability that after $k$ draws,
you have no pair.
This will simply be the number of ways of drawing $k$ socks with no
pairs divided by the total number of ways to draw $k$ socks from the
total number, $2n$.
Since we have to choose $k$ distinct pairs to draw from, and within
each pair there are two options, the number of ways to draw $k$ sock
without a pair is

$$
2^k k! \binom{n}{k} = \frac{2^k n!}{(n-k)!}.
$$

Thus, the probability that no pairs are drawn is

$$
p_k = \frac{2^k n!}{(n-k)!} \cdot \binom{2n}{k}^{-1} = \frac{(n!)^2}{
(2n)!} \cdot 2^k\binom{2n-k}{n-k}.
$$

We have tried to simplify the $k$ dependence so there is a single
binomial coefficient.
Note that $p_k = 0$ for $k \geq n + 1$.
This reflects the fact that as you soon as you have drawn more than
half the socks, you are guaranteed a pair by the [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle).
Let $D$ be the number of draws needed to get a pair.
Then

$$
p_k = \Pr(D > k).
$$

We can use this to find the probability that we get a pair after
exactly $k$ draws:

$$
\Pr(D = k) = \Pr(D > k - 1) - \Pr(D > k + 1) = p_{k-1} - p_{k+1}.
$$

We can evaluate this more explicitly, but this will end up being a
distraction from our main goal: to compute the average number of draws
to get a pair.
Since we have an expression for the probabilities $\Pr(D = k)$, we can
go ahead and compute the average:

$$
\langle D\rangle = \sum_{k = 0}^n k  \cdot \Pr(D = k) = \sum_{k = 0}^n k \cdot 
(p_{k-1} - p_{k+1}). \tag{1} \label{sum}
$$

#### A hypergeometric hack

To make progress on this sum, we can use a trick.
We note that each term $p_k$ occurs twice, first with a multiplier
$k+1$, then a multiplier $-(k+2)$.
Combined, each term appears precisely once!
Thus, we can simplify the sum to

$$
\langle D\rangle = D_n = \sum_{k = 0}^n p_k = \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{(n!)^2}{
(2n)!} \cdot 2^k\binom{2n-k}{n-k}.
$$

This is a difficult sum, and there is (as far as I know) no closed
form expression in terms of elementary functions.
Instead, we can invoke a special function called the *Gauss
hypergeometric function* to package things nicely.
As nicely described in
[*Concrete Mathematics*](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/gkp.html),
the hypergeometric function captures any sum whose terms differ by a
rational function of $k$.
More precisely, the rule is that if we have terms $t_k$ for $k \geq
0$, with a ratio

$$
\frac{t_{k+1}}{t_k} = \frac{z (k+a)(k+b)}{(k+c)} \cdot \frac{1}{k+1},
$$

then we can package the sum of the terms into a hypergeometric
function:

$$
\sum_{k\geq 0} t_k = t_0 \cdot {}_2 F_1(a, b; c; z).
$$

There is a more general version of this relation which lets us package
things into the *generalized hypergeometric function* but we won't
need that here.
Let's apply the relation above to the randomly drawn socks $(\ref{sum})$.
The ratio of the terms $p_k$ is (after a little algebra) seen to be

$$
\frac{p_{k+1}}{p_k} = \frac{2 (k-n)(k+1)}{(k-2n)} \cdot \frac{1}{k+1}.
$$

Note that $p_0 = 1$, since it is certain you cannot draw a pair after
drawing a single sock.
Thus, the average number of socks you need to randomly draw from a
pair from $n$ jumbled pairs is exactly

$$
\langle D\rangle = {}_2 F_1 (-n, 1; -2n; 2). \label{hyper} \tag{2}
$$

#### Simulating socks

As a sanity check, we can simulate the random drawing of socks and see
that the answers agree with our formula.
Here is a scatterplot of the data for $n = 1$ to $n = 20$ pairs of
jumbled socks, with red datapoints obtained from
simulations, and blue from the analytic expression $(\ref{hyper})$.
It's a pretty good match, and gets better as you increase the number
of simulations!

If you're interested, here is the Python code that generates this plot:

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.special as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def randsocks(n):
  socks0 = [[i, 0] for i in range(n)]
  socks1 = [[i, 1] for i in range(n)]
  rand = np.random.permutation(socks0+socks1)
  firstrand = [i for [i, j] in rand]
  k = 0
  while len(firstrand[:k]) == len(list(set(firstrand[:k]))):
    k = k + 1
  return k

averages = []
repeats = 1000
for n in range(1,21):
  results = []
  for rep in range(repeats):
    results.append(randsocks(n))
  av = sum(results)/float(len(results))
  averages.append(av)

hyper = []
for n in range(1, 21):
  hyper.append(sc.hyp2f1(1, -n, -2*n, 2))

fig=plt.figure()
ax=fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1])
ax.scatter(range(1,21), averages,color='r')
ax.scatter(range(1,21), hyper,color='b')
plt.show()
```

#### Alien feet

Lazy aliens might encounter the same problem I did, but with a
difference: they have more than two feet!
In this case, our answer above generalizes in a nice way.
If the alien has $f$ feet, and draws with replacement from $n$ sets of
$f$ socks, then the probability that it has no sets after $k$ draws is

$$
p_k = \frac{(n!)^2}{(fn)!} \cdot f^k\binom{fn-k}{n-k}.
$$

The same trick can be used to evaluate the expected number of draws,
$\langle D\rangle$, and we end up simply replacing $2$ with $f$ in our
expression $(\ref{hyper})$:

$$
\langle D \rangle = \sum_{k=0}^n p_k = {}_2 F_1 (-n, 1; -fn; f).
$$

We can check numerically that this increases as $f$ gets bigger, just
as you might expect.
Pluripedality may have its advantages, but when it comes to drawing
socks from a giant disorganized pile, monopods have a leg up.

#### Biographical postscript

When I was 10 or so, my older sisters gave me a copy of
[*Math Curse*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-ozgmx2nMI), a picture
book about someone who sees math problems everywhere.
Clearly, I have fulfilled their prediction and become a math zombie!
