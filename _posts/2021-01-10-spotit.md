**January 10, 2021.** *I discuss the mathematics of Spot It! (aka
  Dobble in the UK) and its various generalisations, including
  projective planes, combinatorial designs, and an entertaining
  polytopal turducken.*

#### Introduction

*Spot It!* (called *Dobble* in the UK) is a simple card game
based on some relatively deep mathematics.
There is a deck of $55$ cards, each of which has eight symbols printed
on it, from a total symbol vocabulary of $57$.
For each two cards in the deck, there is precisely one symbol in
common, and on each round, the first person to find the shared symbol
between the last card and a newly drawn card wins a point.
Eight is a good number since, according to
[Miller's "law"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two),
the number of objects the average human can hold in short-term memory
is seven.

[online version](http://thewessens.net/ClassroomApps/Main/intersection.html)
by Ken Wessen.
I enjoy the game, but like many mathematically-minded folk
who encounter it, became increasingly distracted by the question: how does it work?

#### Finite projective planes

The game requires that every two cards share precisely one symbol
in common.
If we add the further constraint that each pair of symbols occurs on
one card only, then we have a nice equivalence to the
[finite projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_plane),
provided we interpret a card as a line and a symbol as a point at
which lines intersect, since our constraints become "axioms":

1. Any two lines (cards) intersect at exactly one point (symbol).
2. Any two points (symbols) are joined by exactly one line (card).

Our question becomes about the existence of finite projective planes.
There is a constructive approach, [nicely outlined](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/36798/what-is-the-math-behind-the-game-spot-it)
by Yuval Filmus, which yields the game as a special case.
Let $p$ be a prime number, and consider the finite field $\mathbb{Z}_p
= \\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, p - 1\\}$, viewed as $p$ nodes on a circle.
(You can generalise to prime power fields, but we'll stick with primes
for simplicity.)
We picture $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for $p = 3, 5, 7$ below:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/spotit2.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

To make a projective plane out of $\mathbb{Z}_p$, you do two things:
make it projective and make it a plane.
"Projective" means we add a point at infinity $\infty$,
giving $\mathbb{Z}_p^* := \mathbb{Z}_p \cup \\{\infty\\}$.
"Plane" means we consider all pairs made from $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$,
subject to the proviso that $(m, \infty) \overset{S}{\sim} (\infty,
m)$, where $S$ is the relation.
Modding out by $S$ leads to the projective plane

$$
\mathcal{P}_p = (\mathbb{Z}_p^* \times \mathbb{Z}_p^*)/S,
$$

with

$$
|\mathcal{P}_p| = n = (p+ 1)^2 - p = p^2 + p + 1
$$

points. Here are the steps for $p = 3$:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/spotit3.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

In the first figure, we add the grey point "at infinity" (which occurs
after $2$).
In the second figure, the $x$ coordinate is given by the
colour of the node and the $y$ coordinate by the colour of the
triangle it lies on.
Note that the coloured points on the grey triangle are equivalent to
the corresponding grey points on the coloured triangle.
A line in this geometry is very similar to a line in the Cartesian
plane, and defined as something with a finite slope and finite
$y$-intercept, or a vertical line with a (possibly infinite)
$x$-intercept:

$$
y = mx + c \text{ or } x = a.
$$

We illustrate for $p = 3$ once more.
Note that for the lines with finite slope and intercept, it's
convenient to use points on the grey triangle, while for the vertical
lines, it's more convenient to use grey points:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/spotit4.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>
	
For finite slope and intercept, $m, c \in \mathbb{Z}_p$, while $a
\in \mathbb{Z}_p^*$, so the total number of lines is

$$
d = p^2 + p + 1,
$$

precisely the number of points. We might have expected this from the
fact that in the axioms, the role of lines and points are
interchangeable!
*Spot It!* realises this construction for $p = 7$, with $n = 7^2 + 7 +
1 = 57$ symbols. We can now easily draw a picture of the corresponding
projective plane:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/spotit5.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Each card is a line with $p + 1 = 8$ symbols.
For some mysterious reason, the designers removed two cards, so $d =
55$ rather than $57$.
Speculation on the internet is rife, and I remain agnostic.
But ignoring this mutilation, *Spot It!* is really just a projective
plane built out of the finite field $\mathbb{Z}_7$.
I also can't resist sharing the smallest example, $p = 2$, which leads
to a beautiful object called the *Fano plane*.
The conventional representation is connected to our picture by the following sequence of transformations:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/spotit6.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Draw each row as a triangle, and nest
them rather than stacking them.
Get rid of the copied points on the grey triangle, then rotate the red
triangle so it hits the outer green triangle with three colours along
each edge.
Now draw all the lines, and you have the Fano plane!
(This construction also works if you have the grey triangle on the
outside and get rid of the grey points.)
Technically, this is a graph of the points, with an edge just in case
they lie on some line together, called the *incidence geometry*.

We'll show below that, for any projective plane,
it must be the case that $n = q^2 + q + 1$ for some number $q$ which
is one less than the number of symbols per card.
It is conjectured that $q$ must be a prime power, which completely
solves the projective plane generalisation of *Spot It!*.
But this construction fixes certain features that strike me as
unnatural.
First, we added the constraint that any pair of symbols appears on
precisely one card.
Why not two, or three, or no constraint at all?
Or dually, why not allow for an overlap of more than one symbol?
The answers won't be projective geometries.
But they may still be interesting!

#### Combinatorial designs

We'll start with constraints on co-occurence.
Consider a deck of $d$ cards, with an alphabet of $n$ symbols, and $k$
symbols per card.
Further, suppose each symbol appears on $r$ cards, and each given pair
of symbols appears in $\lambda$ distinct cards.
The resulting arrangement is called a $2$-$(n, k, \lambda)$
[*combinatorial design*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design),
or $2$-design for short.
We don't bother to list $r$ or $b$ since they are determined by the
other parameters according to

$$
dk = nr.
$$

The proof is simply that the LHS counts the total number of symbols
(with multiplicity) by card, and the RHS by symbol.
In general, [Fisher's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_inequality)
states that $d \geq n$, a result we will prove somewhat
unconventionally at the end of the post.
The restriction to $d = n$ but arbitrary $\lambda$ is called a
[symmetric 2-design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_design#Symmetric_2-designs_(SBIBDs)),
and the projective plane is the special case $\lambda = 1$.
We can say a little more about these symmetric designs.
A basic contraint is that

$$
\lambda (n - 1) = k(k - 1),
$$

since both sides count the total number of pairs (with multiplicity),
divided by $n$, with the LHS counting by co-occurrence of symbols, and
the RHS from cards (using $k = r$ for a symmetric 2-design).
Setting $\lambda = 1$ for the projective plane, and writing $q = k -
1$,

$$
n = k(k - 1) + 1 = q(q+1) + 1 = q^2 + q + 1,
$$

so that the form of $n$ is necessary, and $q + 1$ is one more than the number
of symbols per card.
Finally, you might ask about the $2$ in $2$-design.
It turns out there is a generalisation called a $t$-*design*, where
instead of having every pair appear $\lambda$ times, you have every
$t$-element subset of the alphabet appear on $\lambda$ cards.
I won't say more about them, but just wanted to point out they exist and
constitute an even broader generalisation.

<!-- A more delicate constraint comes from the
[Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruck%E2%80%93Ryser%E2%80%93Chowla_theorem). -->

#### Sets and polytopes

I'll end with yet another generalisation which occurred to me before
reading about projective planes or designs.
The basic observation is that we can view a card as a *feature vector*
$\mathbf{v} = (v_i) \in \mathbb{R}^n$, where $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$
label symbols in the alphabet.
We choose a convention where $v_i = 1$ if $i$ is on the card and $0$
otherwise.
As an example, if $n = 4$ and the card contains symbols $1$ and $2$
but not $3$ and $4$, it is represented by a vector $\mathbf{v} = (1, 1, 0, 0)$.
In this representation, the size $k$ of a card is related to the *length* of
the vector: if there are $k$ symbols on a card, then $k$ entries $v_i$ equal $1$,
and hence

$$
|\mathbf{v}|^2 = \sum_i v_i^2 = k \quad \Longrightarrow \quad
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{k}.
$$

In this setup, it's natural to consider an overlap of
$c$ symbols per card, where each card has $k$ symbols.
This can be easily expressed in terms of the *dot product*, and hence
angle between vectors:

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \sum_i u_i v_i = c \quad \Longrightarrow
\quad \cos\theta = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}|
|\mathbf{v}|} = \frac{c}{k}.
$$

A deck of $d$ cards satisfying this condition has a pleasingly
convoluted geometric interpretation.
First, since the entries are binary, each card lies on the vertices of
the unit hypercube in $n$ dimensions:

$$
H_n = \{0, 1\}^n.
$$

Second, since they all have length $\sqrt{k}$, they lie on the
intersection of the hypersphere of radius $\sqrt{k}$ with $H_n$.
Finally, since they all are separated by an angle $\theta =
\cos^{-1}(c/k)$, they are separated by constant distance.
It's easiest to see this by simply measuring the arclength along the
hypersphere, which is $s = \sqrt{k}\theta$.
Since the $d$ points are pairwise separated by the same distance, they
form a $(d-1)$-[simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex),
on both a hypersphere and a hypercube.
It's a polytopal turducken!
We give a simplexample for $n = 2$:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/spotit7.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

We can assemble these vectors as row vectors in a matrix, called the
*incidence matrix*.
Here, for instance, is the Fano plane once more, now realised as a
$6$-simplex in $\mathbb{R}^7$:

$$
\left[
\begin{matrix}
1&0&1&1&0&0&0 \\
1&0&0&0&1&0&1 \\
1&1&0&0&0&1&1 \\
0&1&0&1&0&0&1 \\
0&1&1&0&1&0&0 \\
0&0&1&0&0&1&1 \\
0&0&0&1&1&1&0
\end{matrix}
\right].
$$

There is a nice scheme for generating decks as follows.
Select a deck size $d$, and for the set $D = \\{1, 2, \ldots, d\\}$,
select all subsets of size $r$, $D_r = \binom{D}{r}$.
We now make an alphabet of symbols using these sets, so

$$
n = \left|\binom{D}{r}\right| = \binom{d}{r} = \frac{d!}{(d-r)!r!}.
$$

Our incidence matrix will have $d$ rows and $n$ columns. Each column
corresponds to a subset $s_i$, with $1$ in row $a$ just in case element
$a\in D$ is in $s_i$. Otherwise, it is $0$.
Here is an example for $d = 4$ and $r = 2$:

$$
\left[
\begin{matrix}
1&1&1&0&0&0\\
1&0&0&1&1&0\\
0&1&0&1&0&1\\
0&0&1&0&1&1
\end{matrix}
\right].
$$

In terms of a deck, cards correspond to row vectors $\mathbf{v}^{(a)}$
and symbols to columns.
The length squared of a vector, or the number of symbols per card, is

$$
k = \binom{d - 1}{r - 1},
$$

since if we fix a $1$ in some position, this is the number of ways to
assign the remaining $r - 1$ unit entries in each column, which is realised
as $k$ unit entries per row.
Similarly, it's not hard to see that any two cards generated this way
overlap at $c$ points, for

$$
c = \binom{d - 2}{r - 2}.
$$

If we fix that they both contain some element $b \in D$, for instance, then
this $c$ is the precisely the number of ways we can arrange the
remaining $r - 2$ unit entries to form a set, which will be realised
as $c$ overlaps between rows.
You can generalise to shared triples and so in the obvious way.
The number of distinct decks that can be generated this way is the
number of ways of permuting symbols, $n!$, divided by the number of
ways of permuting rows, since these will simply reorder elements in
the set $D$:

$$
N_{d, r} = \frac{n!}{d!} = \frac{\binom{d}{r}!}{d!}.
$$

This approach is related to the beautiful combinatorics of set intersections (see
e.g. [these notes](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~anuprao/pubs/CSE599sExtremal/lecture9.pdf)).
But we'll finish with a much simpler observation about simplices.
A $(d-1)$-simplex is built from $d$ points with the same pairwise
separation.
It's only possible to embed points with these separations in $d -
1$ dimensions, since each time we add a point, we need to treat the
previous points as a lower-dimensional simplex "base" and place the
new point in another orthogonal dimension.
Since the hypersphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has $n - 1$
dimensions, we learn that $d \leq n$.
This has a nifty consequence: our incidence matrices actually satisfy
the conditions for the *transpose* of an incidence matrix of a
$2$-design.
Since the relation between columns and rows gets swapped, it follows
that for a $2$-design, $d \geq n$.
This is just Fisher's inequality!

<!--
#### The polytopal turducken

We'll finish with a somewhat different generalisation.
(By the by, this is the approach/generalisation that occurred to me
before looking up anything to do with projective geometry or designs.
It is therefore much sketchier.)
The basic idea is to have $n$ symbols (labelled $s_i$), $d$ cards, and $k$ symbols per
card as before. We no longer constrain $\lambda$, but instead
introduce a new variable: $c$, the number of symbols any two cards
have in common.
We can formulate this new constraint geometrically.
A card can be viewed as a vector $\mathbf{v} = (v_i) \in
\mathbb{R}^n$, with $i$ corresponding to symbol labels.
We define

$$
v_i = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{$s_i$ is on the card} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

This has various immediate consequences.
First, any card lies in the set $\\{0, 1\\}^n$, the vertices of the
unit hypercube.
Second, if a card $\mathbf{v}$ has $k$ symbols, then

$$
|\mathbf{v}|^2 = \sum_i (v_i)^2 = k.
$$

This means the vector lies on a hypersphere of radius $\sqrt{k}$
centred at the origin.
Finally, let $V = \{\mathbf{v}^{(a)}\}$ be a set of $d$ cards with $c$
symbols pairwise in common.
Then for any $j \neq k$,

$$
\mathbf{v}^{(a)} \cdot \mathbf{v}^{(b)} = \sum_i v^{(a)}_i v^{(b)}_i = c \quad \Longrightarrow
\quad \cos \theta_{ab} = \frac{\mathbf{v}^{(a)} \cdot \mathbf{v}^{(b)}}{|\mathbf{v}^{(a)}||\mathbf{v}^{(b)}|} = \frac{c}{k}.
$$

Thus, $V$ is a set of vectors which (a) are vertices of the unit
hypercube; (b) lie on the hypersphere of radius $\sqrt{k}$, centred at the origin; and (c) form
the vertices of a regular
$(d-1)$-[simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex), since any
pair of vectors is separated by a constant angle
$\cos^{-1}(c/k)$. I call this a "polytopal turducken" since it
involves a pleasing nesting of the three simplest higher-dimensional
polytopes.
Here is a simple example (in fact, the only example!) for two dimensions, where the hypercube is a
square, the hypersphere is a circle, and the simplex is the
$1$-simplex is formed by two orthogonal vectors on opposite corners: 

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/spotit7.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

This example can be generalised.
The standard embedding of the $(n-1)$-simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^n$, consisting of $d = n$ vectors $\mathbf{v}^{(a)}$
defined by

$$
v^{(a)}_i = \delta^a_i,
$$

where $\delta^a_i$ is the Kronecker delta, equalling $1$ if $a = i$
and $0$ otherwise.
In other words, each card has a single symbol and they enumerate the
alphabet of symbols exactly once, with $c = 0$ and $k = 1$.
This deck makes for a very boring game!
-->

<!--Inspired by Fisher's inequality, we might think we need to take $d
\geq n$, leaving us with the problem of finding an $n$-simplex, with
$n+1$ corners somehow inscribed on the hypercube.

We can use a little group theory to see this is impossible in general.
We can permute the vertices of a regular $n$-simplex any way we like
and leave it looking the same, so the symmetry group has $(n+1)!$ elements.
As for the hypercube, we can rotate any corner into any other, giving
us $2^n$ elements, and fixing a corner, permut any of the $n$ incoming
edges.
By the orbit-stabiliser theorem, this means the group has size

$$
2^n n!.
$$

Since the simplex is embedded in a hypercube, it must realise these
symmetries as a subgroup, and by Lagrange's theorem,

$$
(n+1)! | 2^n n! \quad \Longrightarrow \quad n+1 | 2^n.
$$

It follows that a necessary condition for the embedding is that $n =
2^m - 1$ for some power $m$.
This turns out to be sufficient, as shown in
[Markov (2011)](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/VIGRE/VIGRE2011/REUPapers/Markov.pdf).
But even if we can embed an $n$-simplex on the hypercube, the explicit
constructions show it does not lie on the hypersphere (and indeed,
this is not consistent with the required dimensionality of the set).

So what is going on?
Let's consider the Fano plane again. -->
