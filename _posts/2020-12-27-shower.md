**December 27, 2020.** *Another bathroom-themed post, this time
  on the mysterious billowing of shower curtains. This is related to
  the fact that planes can fly upside down!*

#### The shower curtain effect

A few days ago, I was taking a shower when I noticed the bottom of the
shower curtain nipping at my heels. The bathroom window was closed,
and the house was not particularly drafty, so I began to wonder if
there was another explanation.
Before I left the shower, I had arrived at a hypothesis: the hot water
of the shower is lighter than the cold air outside, so it rises over
the top of the shower curtain, cools, and pushes the column of cold
air down. The cold bottom of this column slips in under the curtain.

I mentioned the phenomena and proposed buoyancy mechanism to my
partner.
She told me she had noticed the same effect in a *cold* shower! In
this case, there is no obvious reason for air to rise over the top of
the curtain, since it's all at the same temperature.
Something else is at play!

#### Einstein's wonky wing

If temperature isn't relevant, the stream of water coming down is.
Presumably, this generates a steam of air moving in the same
direction, and the question becomes: why does this air result in air
being pushed in under the curtain?
Since the air is moving, it is tempting to invoke *Bernoulli's
principle*, which states that in a stream of moving fluid, the sum of
gravitational potential energy, pressure, and speed, is constant:

$$
\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g + P = \text{const}.
$$

Since the air is moving inside of the shower curtain, and
the density should be the same, the pressure should drop inside the
shower. This will result in air rushing in under the curtain.
We draw a cross-section of this explanation below.
On the left is the stationary air.
On the right is the moving air at lower pressure, with the
low-pressure region in grey.
The blue arrow is the resulting force.

This same reasoning is used to explain why holding a piece of paper in
your hand and blowing over the top of it causes the paper to rise.
It's also the conventional explanation for why planes fly.
The idea is that the top surface of a wing or aerofoil is longer than
the bottom, so assuming that air takes the same time to travel over
the top and bottom surface, it must travel faster over the top, and
once again Bernoulli's principle seems to predict a lower pressure
above and hence an upwards lift.

All of these explanations are wrong.
As [this xkcd](https://xkcd.com/803/) succinctly points out, planes
can fly upside down, while the Bernoulli explanation predicts that
lift now points in the wrong direction.
This is a subtle problem, and deceived no lesser a scientist than
Albert Einstein,
[who was hired](http://users.df.uba.ar/sgil/physics_paper_doc/papers_phys/fluids/coanda_effect_94.pdf)
by a German aircraft manufacturer during WWI to design a better
aerofoil.
He added a hump in the middle of the wing to increase the surface
area, assuming this would increase lift due to the conventional
Bernoulli model, but it flopped in wind tunnel experiments.

Similarly, if you blow too closely to the piece of paper, it doesn't
rise.
I couldn't repeat this experiment with the showerhead, but Australian
physics teacher
[Peter Eastwell did](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1050910.pdf),
finding that if the stream of water is too close to the curtain, it
does not billow.
This is inexplicable if we believe the Bernoulli model, since
the pressure should be even lower (since the stream is closer to the
surface) and the force therefore stronger.
Once again, it's back to the drawing board!

#### Entrainment and the Coandă effect

Bernoulli's equation only applies when *viscosity*---"stickiness"
between layers of fluid---is negligible.
But in all the situations above, viscosity plays a key role.
The basic idea is very simple.
A narrow stream of air will tend to pull nearby air along with it due
to stickiness.
Carrying off air particles will create a partial vacuum, i.e. a region
of reduced pressure.
If you want to be precise, you can note that the ideal gas law

$$
PV \propto NT
$$

tells us that, if volume $V$ and temperature $T$ are kept fixed, then
reduced particle number $N$ reduces pressure $P$.
The process of glomming nearby air onto the stream is called
*entrainment*.

Nature will try to fill up these low-pressure regions with air at
atmospheric pressure.
But if there is an obstruction on one side, this side cannot equalise
to atmospheric pressure, since the air can't pass through the obstruction.
So the region between the obstruction and the air stream remains at
low pressure.
There are two things that can happen, and they are not mutually
exclusive.
If the surface is flexible, the air on the other side can push it
towards the low pressure region.
This is what we see with the shower curtain and the piece of paper.

    <div style="text-align:center"><img src

But if the surface cannot come to the air stream, the air stream will
go to the surface, with atmospheric pressure simply pressing it
through the low pressure and onto the surface.
This phenomenon is called the *Coandă effect* after Romanian inventor
Henri Coandă, though it was described eloquently a century earlier by
polymath Thomas Young:

<span style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
The lateral pressure which urges the flame of a candle towards the
stream of air from a blowpipe is probably exactly similar to that
pressure which eases the inflection of a current of air near an
obstacle. Mark the dimple which a slender stream of air makes on the
surface of water. Bring a convex body into contact with the side of
the stream and the place of the dimple will immediately show the
current is deflected towards the body; and if the body be at liberty
to move in every direction it will be urged towards the current...
</span>

#### Flying upside down

The Coandă effect helps explain why planes fly upside down.
The air passing by the aerofoil or wing is entrained and redirected
along the curves.
If this air is directed downwards, then Newton's third law ensures
that lift is generated.
If the plane is upside down, lift is generated in exactly the same
way.
In the images below, the plane is flying to the left, and the blue
arrow represents the reaction force on the plane.
The vertical component is lift.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/shower6.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Clearly, the plane needs to be angle so that the redirected air is
pointing down.
The angle made between the line of the wing (grey line above) and the
horizontal is called the *angle of attack*. A good angle of attack is
crucial for flight.
If the angle is too small, the plane *stalls*, meaning that the lift
generated is not sufficient to keep the plane in the air.
If the angle is too large, it splits the air off into two streams, and
creates a partial vacuum which fills in with turbulent eddies, a process called
[*cavitation*](https://www.discoverhover.org/infoinstructors/guide8.htm).

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/shower7.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

You might think that cavitation could provide more lift, but the
turbulence wobbles the wings, and redirects energy from lift into
vibrating the aerofoil.
Turbulence on an airliner worries passengers because it's
uncomfortable, but the pilot because it might stop the plane from flying!
On the other hand, cavitation can provide short-term lift.
In fact, as
[Peter Eastwell points out](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1050910.pdf),
strong winds rushing over the top of a gabled roof cavitate, and the
resulting pressure difference can rip the roof off!
As Einstein's bungle
suggests, in order to optimize the performance of an airplane wing, we
need the right model for how it works.
The aerodynamics of entrainment and cavitation are complicated topics,
but the humble shower curtain a surprisingly good place to start!
