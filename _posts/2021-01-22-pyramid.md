**January 22, 2021.** *I present an elementary, first-principles
  trick for integrating polynomials, which involves splitting a hypercube into congruent pyramids.*

#### Introduction

Derivatives compute slopes at a point.
Integrals compute areas under curves.
The first is a local operation, involving only information in a
neighbourhood of a point, while the latter is *global*, involving the
value of the function at different points.
This makes integration a lot harder than differentiation!

However, sometimes we have a shortcut for integrating: identifying an
integral with the volume of a solid.
A simple example is a linear function, $f(x) = mx$. When we integrate
from $x = 0$ to $x = b$, the area under the curve is just a triangle,
obeying $A = bh/2$ for height $h = mb$.
We can represent this reasoning in a picture:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/pyramid2.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

But what happens if we want to integrate $x^2$?
There doesn't seem to be any analogous geometry, and we are forced to
do something fancy (like use the
[fundamental theorem of calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus))
if we want to find the area under the curve.

#### A triangular warm-up

But it turns out we haven't tried hard enough!
There is a simple geometric approach to integrating $x^2$ and all the
higher monomials $x^n$.
This lets us integrate any polynomial by simply adding monomial terms.
To see how to do this, let's first think of the integral of a linear
function in a slightly different way.
Rather than as half a square, let's slide the "height" of the triangle
down so it becomes isosceles.
The area is unchanged since $b$ and $h$ have now swapped roles.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/pyramid3.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Now we double this triangle, and see it covers half of a square of
area $2bh$. Since twice the area of the triangle equals half the area
of this square,

$$
2A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2bh \quad \Longrightarrow \quad A = \frac{1}{2}bh.
$$

This may seem like a convoluted reinterpretation, but it generalises
in a lovely way to help us integrate polynomials.

#### Pyramids and hypercubes

A hypercube or $n$-cube is a cube in $n$ dimensions.
Formally, we can view it as all points

$$
I^n = \{(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) : x_i \in [0, 1]\} = [0, 1]^n.
$$

For instance, a $1$-cube is the unit interval $I = [0, 1]$, while a
$2$-cube is the unit square $[0 ,1]^2$.
The $3$-cube is what we usually mean by a "cube".
Now, the length of the unit interval is $1$, the area of the unit
square is $1^1 = 1$, and volume of the unit cube is $1^3 = 1$.
The pattern continues, with the volume simply given by the product of
the length of each side of the hypercube, $1^n = 1$.

    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/pyramid4.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Let us now divide a hypercube in the following way: draw a point at
the centre, and from that point, draw a line to each corner.
These lines form the edges of a $(n-1)$-hypercube-based hyperpyramid,
which sounds a bit crazy but is actually very simple.
We illustrate for the simple cases below.

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/pyramid5.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

Each of these (hyper)pyramids is congruent, i.e. has the same shape,
so to work out their volume, all we need to do is compute how many there
are.
Since each pyramid has a $(n-1)$-cube or *face* as a base, this is the
same as counting faces.
But this is easy: along any dimension there are two faces,
corresponding to fixing $x_i = 0$ or $x_i = 1$ for some $i$.
Thus, there are $2n$ faces.
Just to check this makes sense, we have $2 \cdot 1 = 2$ "faces" or
endpoints for a line, $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ sides to a square, and $2 \cdot
3 = 6$ faces for a cube.
Thus, each pyramid has a volume

$$
V_n = \frac{1}{2n}.
$$

To connect to our warm-up exercise, note that in two dimensions, the 
pyramid is a triangle with a side as its base.

#### Slicing pyramids

Let's now focus on a single pyramid.
We can move along the line from the tip to the centre of the base, and
graph the area of the cross-section of pyramid passing through that point,
parallel to the base.
Each slice will be a shrunken copy of the base itself.
As examples, on the square the "pyramid" is just a quarter triangle.
The cross-section is a line (a copy of the base, which is a side of the
square), which is increasing linearly in length.
Similarly, for a cube, the pyramid is a bonafide square-based pyramid,
and each slice is a square as well.
We draw some pictures below:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/pyramid6.png"/>
	</div>
	</figure>

As we go along, the side length of the slice will change linearly.
But the *area* will change in a way that depends on the dimension we
are working in! It stays linear on the square, since it has $2 - 1 =
1$ dimension.
For a cube with $n = 3$, the slice is a square whose area changes
*quadratically*.
The pattern continues, and in $n$ dimensions, slicing a pyramid
results in a cross-section which grows as $x^{n-1}$ for a parameter
$x$ going from $x = 0$ at the tip of the pyramid to $x = 1$ at the
base.

#### Integrating monomials

We can add up the area of each cross-section precisely by integrating
with respect to $x$.
The answer is not quite the volume of the pyramid, however, since the
distance from the tip of the pyramid to the centre of the base is
actually $d = 1/2$.
So $x$ is *twice* the actual distance.
If we want to integrate to find the volume, the correct "infinitesimal
width" of a cross-section is not $dx$, but $dx/2$.
The corresponding integral should then give us the volume we
calculated above:

$$
\int_0^{1} x^{n-1} \, \frac{dx}{2} = V_n = \frac{1}{2n} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \int_0^{1} x^{n-1} \, dx = \frac{1}{n}.
$$

If instead of a unit hypercube, we have a cube of side length $b$,
then the volume of the whole hypercube is $b^n$, and hence the volume
of a pyramid is $b^n/2n$.
If we let our parameter $x$ go from $x = 0$ at the tip to $x = b$ at
the base, then once again it is twice the distance, and the same
reasoning shows that

$$
\int_0^{b} x^{n-1} \, dx = \frac{b^n}{n}.
$$

Thus, we have geometrically integrated an arbitrary monomial!
