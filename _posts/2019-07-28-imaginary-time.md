**July 28, 2019.** *Imaginary time is a trick for turning heat into
geometry. More precisely, hot systems repeat themselves in imaginary
time. This perspective leads to a quick proof of the Unruh effect
(empty space looks hot when you accelerate) and with a little more
work, to Hawking radiation (black holes are hot since observers near the horizon accelerate).*

## Introduction

*Prerequisites: quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, special relativity.*

Thermodynamic systems, like light bulb filaments, puddles, or stars, consist of many
components sharing energy and interacting at random.
Rather than predict what will happen exactly, it
makes more sense to consider a probability distribution over
configurations of the system, also called an *ensemble*.
There are different sensible choices, depending on experimental
conditions, but they all yield the same answers when you have lots of
particles.

The easiest to work with is the *canonical ensemble*, where the
temperature $T$ is fixed.
The probability of seeing a state with energy $E$ dies off
exponentially, and is controlled by the ratio of $E$ to the characteristic
thermal energy, $k_B T$, where $k_\text{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant:

$$
p_\beta(E) \propto e^{-\beta E}.
$$

This exponential is often called a *Boltzmann factor*.
We can immediately write down the full probability distribution, using
the fact that it must be unit normalised:

$$
p_\beta(E) = \frac{1}{Z[\beta]}e^{-\beta E}, \quad Z[\beta] = \sum_{E} n(E) e^{-\beta E}.
$$

Here, $n(E)$ is the *density of states*, telling us roughly how
many ways the system can be at energy $E$ (more precisely, what
volume of classical phase space they occupy).
The normalisation factor $Z[\beta]$ is called the *partition
function*, and it captures all the statistical properties of the system.
For instance, we can extract the average energy of the system using a derivative:

$$
\langle E \rangle = \sum_E n(E) p_\beta(E) E = \frac{\sum_E n(E) e^{-\beta E}
E}{\sum_E \rho(E) e^{-\beta}} = \frac{-\partial_\beta Z[\beta]}{Z[\beta]} =
-\partial_\beta \ln Z[\beta].
$$

Another example is the *Helmholtz free energy* $F = -k_\text{B} T \ln
Z[\beta]$, which is minimised in equilibrium.
Free energy tells us at which point the density of states balances
exponential suppression of high energy states.

## Quantum statistical mechanics

The partition function also controls the statistics of *quantum*
thermodynamic systems.
Instead of a probability distribution $p_\beta$ over classical
configurations, we have a probability distribution over *quantum
states*, with high energy states suppressed by Boltzmann factors:

$$
\hat{\rho}_\beta = \frac{1}{Z[\beta]}\sum_E e^{-\beta E}|E\rangle\langle E|.
$$

Here, we are using Dirac's bra-ket notation, and $|E\rangle\langle
E|$ projects onto the energy eigenstate $|E\rangle$ (assumed
non-degenerate for simplicity of notation).
Instead of having unit norm, the density $\hat{\rho}_\beta$ is defined to have unit
*trace*:

$$
1 = \mbox{Tr}[\hat{\rho}_\beta] = \frac{1}{Z[\beta]}\sum_E e^{-\beta
E}\mbox{Tr}|E\rangle\langle E|]= \frac{1}{Z[\beta]}\sum_E e^{-\beta
E}.
$$

The normalisation $Z[\beta] = \sum_E E^{-\beta E}$ is just the
classical sum over Boltzmann factors as before.

There is a nicer way to write the density $\hat{\rho}_\beta$.
What is an energy eigenstate?
Well, it's just an eigenvector of the system's *Hamiltonian*
$\hat{H}$, with $\hat{H}|E\rangle = E|E\rangle$.
But by a standard linear algebra trick, we can write any
diagonalisable operator as a sum of projectors onto its eigenvectors,
weighted by its eigenvalues:

$$
\hat{H} = \sum_E E |E\rangle \langle E.
$$

It follows that

$$
\hat{\rho}_\beta = \frac{1}{Z[\beta]}e^{-\beta \hat{H}}, \quad \mbox{Tr}[e^{-\beta \hat{H}}] = Z[\beta].
$$

So the density and partition function can be written simply in terms
of the Hamiltonian.

## Amplitudes and Wick rotation

The Hamiltonian provides the connection to imaginary time.
First, recall that the *SchrÃ¶dinger equation* tells us how to evolve a
state $|\psi\rangle$ of the system using the Hamiltonian.
This is simple to solve when the Hamiltonian itself is time-independent:

$$
i\hbar \partial_t |\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}|\psi(t)\rangle \quad
\Longrightarrow \quad |\psi(t)\rangle  = e^{-i\hat{H}t}|\psi(0)\rangle.
$$

We call $e^{-i\hat{H}t} = U(t)$ the *propagator*.
The amplitude for a system to go from state $|\phi\rangle$ to
$|\varphi\rangle$ in time $t$ is just

$$
\langle\phi|U(t)|\varphi\rangle,
$$

since the $U(t)$ updates the state, and the overlap with the bra
$\langle\phi|$ tells us "how much" of $|\phi\rangle$ is in the evolved
state $|\varphi(t)\rangle$.
The *return amplitude* for a state $|\phi\rangle$ is just the
amplitude for returning to the state a time $t$ later,

$$
\langle\phi|U(t)|\phi\rangle.
$$

We can give things a turn of the screw now.
Instead of regular time, we can do something unexpected, and consider
*imaginary time*, defined by $\tau = i\tau$.
This is called *Wick rotation*, since we can imagine multiplying by
$i$ as rotating by $\pi/2$ on a sort of complex plane for time.
The corresponding propagator actually suppresses things exponentially:

$$
U(-i\tau) = U_\text{im}(\tau) =  e^{-\hat{H}\tau}.
$$

For an energy eigenstate $|E\rangle$, the *imaginary return amplitude* is just a
Boltzmann weight:

$$
\langle E| U_\text{im}(\tau) | E\rangle = e^{-E \tau}.
$$

We can reinterpret the density matrix in terms of
these imaginary return amplitudes.
Instead of viewing it as a probability distribution over energy eigenstates, we can view $\hat{\rho}_\beta$ as
projecting onto a system which always returns to itself after
imaginary time $\beta$, i.e. is *periodic in imaginary time*.

Concretely, whenever we evaluate some observable $\hat{A}$ in thermal
state, the expectation is

$$
\langle\hat{A}\rangle_\beta = \frac{\sum_E \langle E|e^{-\beta\hat{H}}\hat{A}|E\rangle}{Z[\beta]}.
$$

The numerator is the sum of expectations over all ways the system can return to its
initial state after imaginary time $\beta$.
The denominator is the amplitude for this imaginary periodicity
property.
The whole expectation, then, takes the form of a *conditional
expectation* in a state with imaginary periodicity.
You can see this by analogy with the conditional probability,

$$
\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A\cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}.
$$

---

**Exercise 1.** *Statistical and quantum mechanics.*

1. When there are many particles in the system, the sum in the
   canonical ensemble tends to be dominated by a single energy $E^*$,
   where the probability is concentrated.
   Argue that the free energy

   $$
   F = -k_\text{B}T \ln Z[\beta] \approx E^* - T S(E^*),
   $$

   where $S(E) = k_\text{B}\ln n(E)$ is the *entropy*.
   This explains the more common definition of Helmholtz free energy as $F =
   E - TS$.

2. Show that

   $$
   \hat{\rho}_\beta = \frac{1}{Z[\beta]}e^{-\beta \hat{H}}, \quad \mbox{Tr}[e^{-\beta \hat{H}}] = Z[\beta].
   $$

   You can use the result (true for spectral decompositions in general) that

   $$
   e^{\lambda \hat{H}} = \sum_E e^{\lambda E}|E\rangle\langle E|.
   $$

3. Derive the simple expression for the thermal expectation,
   $\langle\hat{A}\rangle_\beta = \mbox{Tr}[\hat{\rho}_\beta\hat{A}]$.

## Rindler coordinates and the Unruh effect

Let's now turn from quantum mechanics to special relativity.
To keep life simple, we stick to two dimensions with Minkowski
coordinates $(t, x)$.
Recall that the signed distance $s^2$ from the origin to a point in
spacetime $P(t, x)$ is given by

$$
s^2 = -t^2 + x^2.
$$

For small displacements, this defines the *Minkowski metric*

$$
ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2.
$$

The curves at fixed distance $s^2 > 0$ from the origin are hyperbolas
covering the east-west quadrants.
We can use these hyperbolas to
define a new coordinate system on, say, the east quadrant:

$$
x = \alpha^{-1} \cosh\xi, \quad t = \alpha^{-1} \sinh\xi.
$$

Note that $s^2 = \alpha^{-2}$ on a hyperbola, and $t = x \tanh\xi$ for
fixed $\xi \in \mathbb{R}$.
Thus, we can draw our coordinates as follows:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src ="/images/posts/imaginary-time-2.png"
    width="75%" />
		    <figcaption><i>Left: the parameter $\alpha$ labels
    hyperbolas (red) with the acceleration needed to stay on them, while Rindler time $\xi$ moves
    along them. Right: in imaginary time, hyperbolas becomes circles
    of radius $\rho$ and angle $\theta$.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

---

**Exercise 2.** *Rindler coordinates.*
1. Verify the geometric description of $\alpha, \xi$ above.
2. For an observer on a fixed hyperbola labelled by $\alpha$, verify
   that their proper time is $\alpha \xi$ and their proper
   acceleration has magnitude $\alpha$.
   This gives a second way of interpreting Rindler coordinates.
3. Show that the Minkowski metric in Rindler coordinates is

    $$
    ds^2 = -\frac{1}{\alpha^2}d\xi^2 + \frac{1}{\alpha^4} d\alpha^2.
    $$

4. Defining $\rho = 1/\alpha$, show that the metric takes the simple form

    $$
    ds^2 = -\rho^2\, d\xi^2 + d\rho^2.
	$$

---

To understand the thermal properties of Rinder coordinates, we
go to imaginary time, $\xi = -i \theta$.
This leads to the metric

$$
ds^2 = \rho^2\, d\theta^2 + d\rho^2.
$$

This is precisely the metric on a disk, with radius $\rho$ and polar
angle $\theta$.
If this language of metrics is confusing, we can see it explicitly from the change of
coordinates:

$$
x = \rho \cosh(-i\theta) = \rho\cos\theta, \quad \tau = it = i\rho
\sinh(-i\theta) = \rho \sin\theta.
$$

Of course, the period in imaginary time depends on whether we choose
$\tau$, $\theta$, or the imaginary proper time $\alpha\theta$.
It turns out that *temperature is in the eye of the beholder*, and we
must choose the imaginary proper time to determine the energies they
will measure.
Since the proper time is $\alpha\xi$, the period in proper
imaginary time is $2\pi \rho$.
Recalling our mantra, we are led to predict that the "system" --- empty
space --- appears thermal, with temperature

$$
T_\text{U} = \frac{\alpha}{2\pi}.
$$

The fact that empty space looks thermal to an accelerating observer is
called the *Unruh effect*, and $T_\text{U}$ the *Unruh temperature*.
If we restore the factor of $\hbar$ omitted from SchrÃ¶dinger's
equation, the factor of $k_\text{B}$ omitted from the inverse
temperature $\beta$, and the factor of $c$ omitted from the Minkowski
metric, we get the expression

$$
T_\text{U} = \frac{\hbar \alpha}{2\pi k_\text{B} c}.
$$

In our earlier quantum mechanics discussion, a thermal density arose
from having a *geometry* with imaginary periodicity.
For the same reason, when we go to define quantum fields on the
imaginary Rindler spacetime, they will be in a thermal state.
To show this is true requires a discussion of what is called the *path
integral* approach to quantum field theory and quantum mechanics,
which is beyond our scope here. But the arguments work in a very similar
(if slightly more technical) fashion, and the conclusions are the
same: the accelerating observer will see a thermal bath of particles,
such as photons and any other fields that happen to be around.

## Hawking radiation from Newtonian gravity

Black holes are attractive, and therefore induce acceleration at the event horizon.
The Unruh effect, combined with the equivalence principle, then
*implies* the existence of Hawking radiation.
In the next section, we will show this a bit more carefully using a
few basic ideas from general relativity.
Here, we will content ourselves with a *Newtonian* argument which,
although it is physically misleading, gives the right answer.

Imagine a black hole of mass $M$ at the origin of flat space.
The classical escape velocity for a test particle of mass $m$ a
distance $r$ away is given by equating the kinetic and potential
energies and solving for $v$:

$$
\frac{GMm}{r} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad v^2 = \frac{2GM}{r}.
$$

To find the event horizon $r_\text{h}$ of the black hole, we simply set the escape
velocity to the speed of light $v = c$, supposing it is the point at which
not even light can escape:

$$
r_\text{h} = \frac{2GM}{c^2}.
$$

An observer sitting at the horizon wants to fall into the black hole,
and needs to accelerate *away* in order just to remain stationary.
The acceleration needed is just given by the inverse square law:

$$
\alpha = \frac{GM}{r_\text{h}^2} = \frac{c^4}{4GM}.
$$

If we forget all about spacetime curvature, and just imagine that an
observer hovering at the black hole horizon is accelerating at
$\alpha$ in flat space, we expect a version of the Unruh effect with temperature

$$
T_\text{H} = \frac{\hbar \alpha}{2\pi k_\text{B} c} = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi k_\text{B} GM}.
$$

This is precisely the temperature predicted by Hawking!
Our imaginary time approach leads us (via some Newtonian
sleight-of-hand) to the incredible conclusion that black holes are
hot, spewing out a thermal spectrum of particles just like flat space
does for an accelerating observer.

## Hawking radiation from Euclidean gravity*

The preceding argument is cute, but gravity is not Newtonian!
We can fix it up using some tools from general relativity, focusing on
spherically symmetric black holes for simplicity.
When we Wick rotate, the signature of the metric becomes Euclidean
$(-,+,+,+) \to (+,+,+,+)$, so this version of general relativity is called
*Euclidean gravity*.

Imagine an observer far from the black hole, who has proper time $t$
and sets up spherical coordinates with radial coordinate $r$ and the
black hole at $r = 0$.
In these coordinates, small displacements have signed length given by
the *Schwarzschild metric*:

$$
ds^2 = -f(r)\, dt^2 + \frac{1}{f(r)} dr^2 + \cdots
$$

where $f(r)$ is a function we'll discuss in a moment, and the
$\cdots$ indicate additional spherical coordinates that wont' matter
to us.

Let's consider an outgoing radial null ray with parameter $\lambda$,
and radial position $r(\lambda)$ obeying

$$
0 = -f(r)\, \dot{t}^2 + \frac{1}{f(r)} \dot{r}^2 \quad \Longrightarrow
\quad \frac{\dot{r}}{\dot{t}} = \frac{dr}{dt} = f(t).
$$

We see that if $f(r) = 0$, an outgoing light ray will be "stuck".
Since nothing travels faster than light, *nothing* will be able to
leave the region $r < r_\text{h}$ for an *event horizon* where
$f(r_\text{h}) = 0$.

Suppose that at the horizon, the function $f$ vanishes but has nonzero
derivative, i.e. Taylor-expanding to first order gives

$$
f(r) \approx f(r_\text{h}) (r - r_\text{h}) + \cdots
$$

Then to first order, we can expand the Schwarzschild metric as

$$
ds^2 = -f'(r_\text{h})(r-r_\text{h}) \, dt^2 +
\frac{1}{f'(r_\text{h})(r-r_\text{h})} dr^2 + \cdots
$$

Let's go to imaginary time and define new coordinates $\rho, \theta$ by

$$
\rho^2 = \frac{4(r-r_\text{h})}{f'(r_\text{h})}, \quad \theta =
-\frac{1}{2}i|f'(r_\text{h})| t.
$$

Substituting these back into the metric, we get

$$
ds^2 = \rho^2 \, d\theta^2 + d\rho^2 + \cdots
$$

---

**Exercise 3.** *Euclidean black holes.*
1. Do the algebra to deduce the metric above.
2. Adapt the argument for a metric

    $$
    ds^2 = -f(r)\,dt^2 + \frac{1}{g(r)}dr^2 + \cdots
	$$

	where both $f, g$ vanish at $r = r_\text{h}$ but have nonvanishing
    derivatives.

---

Ignoring the $\cdots$, this is precisely the form of the metric we saw
in Rindler coordinates!
We learn that the near-horizon region of a black hole resembles
Rindler coordinates on flat space.
Moreover, for the imaginary proper time associated to the far away
observer, the period is $4\pi/|f'(r_\text{h})|$.
Hence, from afar, the black hole looks hot, with temperature

$$
T_\text{H} = \frac{|f'(r_\text{h})|}{4\pi}.
$$

Now consider a spherically symmetric black hole in four dimensions.
Our earlier Newtonian argument, or the correct general relativistic argument, shows
that there is a horizon at $r_\text{h} = 2GM$.
The relevant choice of $f(r)$ (which solves Einstein's equation) is

$$
f(r) = \frac{r - 2GM}{r} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad f(2GM) = 0, \quad f'(2GM) = \frac{1}{2GM}.
$$

Plugging this into our expression for the Hawking temperature, we
recover our earlier, somewhat dodgy Newtonian result

$$
T_\text{H} = \frac{1}{8\pi GM}.
$$

The advantage of talking about things this way is that we can
calculate temperatures for a much wider range of black holes.

---

**Exercise 4.** *Hot black holes in higher dimensions.*
In $d$ dimensions, a Schwarzschild black hole is associated with a
function

$$
f(r) = 1 -\frac{\mu}{r^{d-3}}
$$

for some constant $\mu \propto GM$.
Show that the temperature is

$$
T_\text{H} = \frac{d-3}{4\pi}(2\mu)^{-1/(d-3)}.
$$
