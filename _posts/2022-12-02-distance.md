**December 2, 2022.** *Humans are the measure of all things, though
  not in the sense Protagoras meant. I show how to estimate distance
  using only your hands and feet.*

## Introduction
---

The Greek philosopher Protagoras famously stated that "man is the
measure of all things". He was also skeptical about whether math could
be applied to the real world. According to Aristotle, he arged that
"perceptible lines are not the kind of things the geometer talks
about".
We'll make a bad Protagoran joke and use humans, the "measure of all things", to
measure distances by exploiting the geometry of "perceptible lines".

<b>Estimating distance.</b> <br>

Is it possible to estimate <i>distance</i> to an object using only hands and feet?
</div>

## Theory
---

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px
solid green; line-height:1.5">
<b>The rule of thumbs (I).</b> <br>

If an object has apparent size $f$,
and after $s$ steps has apparent size $f'$, the distance to the object is
$$
fd = f'(d - s) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad d = \frac{s}{1 -(f/f')}.
$$
</div>

So, consider a distant object you want to find the distance to.
Hold your hand out at a fixed distance from your eyes and fixed
orientation (e.g. horizontal), and estimate the size of the object in
fingers $f$.
(For best results, use an integer number of fingers.)
Your arm and hands form a triangle which is similar to the triangle
formed by the distant object:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/distance1.png" width="700"/>
	<figcaption><i>Similar triangles formed by your hand and the object.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

If $a$ is the length of your arm, $h$ the actual height, $d$ the
distance to the object and $f$ the apparent height in fingers, then

$$
\frac{f}{a} = \frac{h}{d}. \tag{1} \label{f}
$$

Now walk $s$ steps towards the object, so that it has finger
width $f'$.
We now have a new set of similar triangles:

<figure>
    <div style="text-align:center"><img src
    ="/images/posts/distance2v2.png" width="700"/>
	<figcaption><i>Similar triangles after moving towards the object.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

The ratio of sides now obeys

$$
\frac{f'}{a} = \frac{h}{d-s}, \tag{2} \label{fdash}
$$

where we measure distance in steps.
We can rearrange $(\ref{f})$ and $(\ref{fdash})$ to eliminate the length of the arm, $a$, and physical
height $h$, to find a method for distance measurement about which
Protagoras might have mixed feelings.

## Practice
---

Take the transition from $f = 3$ to $f' = 4$.
In this case, the distance estimate is

$$
d = \frac{s}{1 -(f/f')} = \frac{s}{1 - 3/4} = 4s,
$$

or four times the number of steps. I find this works with $90$-$95\%$
accuracy for distances on the order of $50$ steps.
I suspect that varying finger width and step length are the main source of error;
arm length $a$ can be fixed by maximally extending the arm, and
orientation of the hands can be fixed by a reference line, e.g. the
horizon.

Beyond varying width, the main disadvantage of fingers as a
measurement device is their resolution.
By counting the number of steps from $f = 9$ to $f' = 10$, you estimate $d \approx 10s$, but
that is the best you can do. For large ratios, you need to replace
fingers with a finer measurement instrument, such as a clear plastic
ruler held at arm's length.
Although you will get better results and enable yourself to measure
larger distances, you may look a tad eccentric.
But as Protagoras informs us, that is a tradeoff that each individual
must assess themselves.

## Extension
---

<div style="background-color: #cfc ; padding: 10px; border: 1px
solid green; line-height:1.5">
<b>The rule of thumbs (II).</b> <br>

The height of an object is related to finger width $f$, arm length
$a$, and distance $d$, by

$$
h = \frac{df}{a}.
$$
</div>

It's simple to extend this method to estimate height.
Once $d$ is known, we can use $(\ref{f})$ to give the physical height
(or width, or whatever we've measured) in terms of other quantities:

$$
h = \frac{df}{a}.
$$

Now, if we know $a$ in finger lengths, we will get an estimate of the
height in steps.
That's a bit silly, so I suggest learning your arm length, finger
width, and step size in meters.
But note that, for an order of magnitude guess, one step is around
$1.2$ arm lengths, so the height is $1.2$ times the
number of steps times the finger span.

Example: I estimated a car had size $f = 3 \text{ fingers} \approx 4
\text{ cm}$ at a distance $d = 40$ steps.
This leads to a height estimate

$$
h \approx 40 \times 1.2 \times 4 \text{ cm} \approx 1.9 \text{ m},
$$

which is probably an overestimate but in the right ballpark.
Once again, a ruler leads to more accurate results at the cost of
visible dorkiness.
