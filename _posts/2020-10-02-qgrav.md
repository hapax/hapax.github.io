**October 2, 2020.** *People often say that quantum gravity is hard
  because quantum mechanics and gravity are incompatible. I'll give a
  short, relatively non-technical explanation of the real problem:
  powerful microscopes make black holes. This is related to various
  other statements, such as diffeomorphism invariance and the
  impossibility of local observables, which we briefly sketch.*

#### Introduction

Gravity is a theory of heavy things; quantum mechanics is a theory of
fuzzy things; *quantum gravity* applies to things which are both heavy and fuzzy.
People often say that the two theories are "incompatible" because
they use different mathematical frameworks.
This makes it seem like a technical problem, which is misleading.
The real problem is that the details of quantum gravity are hidden
inside black holes!
Let's see why.

#### Microscopes make energy

Suppose we have a microscope which has can resolve lengths $\Delta x$.
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that the smaller this
resolution, the larger the uncertainty about the momentum of things we
measure, with

$$
\Delta p \gtrsim \frac{\hbar}{\Delta x}
$$

for Planck's constant $\hbar \approx 10^{-34} \text{ J/s}$.
We can relate this to the energy of the particles using Einstein's
famous $E = mc^2$.
In fact, we will write it in the much less well-known form

$$
E^2 = m^2c^4 = p^2c^2 + m_0^2 c^4,
$$

where $m_0$ is the mass of the particle at rest, $c = 3 \times 10^8
\text{ m/s}$ is the speed of light, and $m$ is the *relativistic
mass*, which increases (without limit) as the particle speeds up.
When the particle is moving very quickly, the momentum can be much
larger than the rest mass energy, and $p \approx E/c$.
If we measure very small distances, Heisenberg's principle tells us we
will be smacking around particles at very high momenta, so this is the
form we should use.
Thus, the uncertainty in the energy of particles our microscope is
examining is

$$
\Delta E \sim \frac{\hbar c}{\Delta x}\;.
$$

#### Energy makes black holes

Let's now recall Newton's universal law of gravitation,

$$
F = \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2},
$$

where $G = 6.7\times 10^{-11} \text{ N m}^2\text{ /kg}$ is *Newton's
constant*.
We can use this to estimate the size of a black hole!
A black hole is a region of space where gravity is so strong light
is unable to escape.
To see how light figures in Newton's law, we need to give it a mass.
In classical physics, light is massless, but but we know better: Einstein's
formula tells us that it has some *relativistic* mass related to its
energy, $E = mc^2$.
[If you're curious, the mass of a particle of light, the photon,
depends on its frequency $f$ via

$$
m = \frac{E}{c^2} = \frac{2\pi\hbar f}{c^2},
$$

using the formula for the energy of a photon, $E = 2\pi \hbar f$, also discovered by Einstein.]
Let's continue.
For a black hole of mass $M$, and radius $r_s$, the force it exerts on
a photon with mass-energy $m$ is

$$
F \sim \frac{GMm}{r_s^2}.
$$

Using the work formula, we can view force as energy divided by
distance.
Since the energy of the photon is $E = mc^2$, and the relevant
distance is probably the black hole size $r_s$, we have

$$
\frac{mc^2}{r_s} \sim \frac{GMm}{r_s^2} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad
r_s \sim \frac{GM}{c^2}.
$$

Although we've been rather sloppy, this guess is correct up to a
factor of $2$!
So, if we take a mass $M$ and squish into a ball of radius $\lesssim
GM/c^2$, it will make a black hole.

#### Microscopes make black holes

Let's return to our microscope.
Zooming in makes energy fluctuations, and by $E = mc^2$ these
fluctuations have mass.
The associated black hole radius is

$$
r_s \sim \frac{Gm}{c^2} = \frac{G\Delta E}{c^4} = \frac{G\hbar}{\Delta x \cdot c^3}.
$$

It may seem sketchy to replace $E$ with $\Delta E$, but if the energy
of particles has fluctuations of size $\Delta E$ around $E = 0$, some
of them will have energy $E$.
We can clean up this expression by packaging all these constants into
a single object called the *Planck length*:

$$
\ell_P := \sqrt{\frac{G\hbar}{c^3}}.
$$

Then the associated black hole radius for our microscope is

$$
r_s \sim \frac{\ell_P^2}{\Delta x}.
$$

Now, what does this all mean?
Very simply, if the resolution $\Delta x$ of our microscope is within
the associated black hole radius, then our energy fluctuations will
produce a tiny black hole!
We won't see anything at all this black hole at all.
This happens when

$$
\Delta x \lesssim r_s \sim \frac{\ell_P^2}{\Delta x} \quad
\Longrightarrow \quad \Delta x \lesssim \ell_P.
$$

In other words, we can't see below the Planck scale without making
black holes.
Clearly, microscopes this powerful should be kept away from theorists!

#### No local observables

So, the basic difficulty with quantum gravity is that zooming in makes
black holes.
This problem appears in many different guises.
For instance, suppose I want to make statements about what is
happening at a *point* $X$ in spacetime, e.g. an electron has some
probability of being observed there.
So, I wait around with my electron detector to see if the electron
appears at $P$, and in due course, it does.
Or does it really?
If my electron detector can tell what's happening at the point $P$
itself, it's acting as a microscope with infinite resolution!
Clearly, this is not consistent with the argument above.
At best, I can look for electrons in regions larger than the Planck length.

Instead of talking about black holes, we usually say that spacetime
*breaks down* when we try to look too close.
For this reason, it doesn't make sense to talk about what is
happening at a point in spacetime.
The electron detector is an example of something called a *local
observable*: it is defined at a point (local) and makes a
quantum-mechanical measurement (observable).
This conclusion is so important we put it in a quote box:

<span align="center" style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
*In quantum gravity, there are no local observables.*
</span> 

In fact, this conclusion is already suggested by Einstein's
*classical* theory of gravity, general relativity.
Without going into details, we can briefly explain why, and some of
the fancy words physicists use to dress up the idea.

#### Diffeomorphism invariance

In Newtonian gravity, spacetime is a sort of fixed arena where objects
float around and exert forces on each other. In this picture, gravity
is just another force.
Einstein's profound realization was that gravity isn't a real force at
all!
Rather, *gravity is the shape of space*, and *space is shaped by matter.*
In the beautiful maxim of John Wheeler,

<span align="center" style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
*Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.*
</span>

It doesn't make much sense to talk about stuff happening at a point
$P$ itself.
Rather, physically meaningful statements will involve the shape of
space and matter in the vicinity of $P$.
The shape of space is captured by an object $\mathbf{G}$ called the
*Einstein tensor*, while the "shape" of matter is captured by an
energy-like quantity called the *stress-energy tensor* $\mathbf{T}$.
The governing equation of general relativity is the *Einstein field
equation*:

$$
\mathbf{G} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\mathbf{T}.
$$

Spacetime curves on the left; matter moves on the right; the equality
sign means they are giving each other instructions.
This is not the only theory of gravity you can write down, and indeed, there are
many ways to generalize Einstein's equation. But they should obey
Einstein's insight that gravitational physics only depends on the shape of things.

Physicists have a nice hack for enforcing this shape-only dependence.
Clearly, the label of the point $P$ will depend on my labelling
system.
But however I choose to label $P$ (and the surrounding points), the
shape of space doesn't change.
A sphere is still a sphere, even if I label points using days of the
week!
Thus, physically meaningful statements do not depend on how we label points.
Physicists like fancy terminology, and "relabelling points" often goes
by "diffeomorphism", and "does not depend on" by "invariance".
So in fancy language, the constraint becomes

<span align="center" style="padding-left: 20px; display:block">
*Physically meaningful statements are invariant under diffeomorphisms.*
</span>

I can't really ask about whether an electron appeared at $P$ because
this question depends on how I label $P$.
Like I said above, there is no quantum mechanics here.
Once we add quantum mechanics, Nature itself enforces invariance under
diffeomorphisms by shrouding ill-formed questions with black holes.

#### What is quantum gravity about?

The moral is that, in quantum gravity, spacetime fluctuates.
If I zoom in enough, these fluctuations are violent enough to form
black holes, so there are no local observables.
This is also suggested by the *classical* invariance of general
relativity under relabelling points.
But if spacetime itself is fluctuating, what is quantum gravity even about?
We'll finish with a few possibilities.

1. *Black holes.* Black holes are the guardians of the secrets of
quantum gravity, appearing whenever we try to probe below the Planck
scale. But they are also guides, providing generous (albeit indirect)
clues such as the [Bekenstein-Hawking entropy](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Bekenstein-Hawking_entropy).
Understanding how they store and release information is one of the
keys to making progress in quantum gravity.
2. *Non-local observables.* Even though local observables do not make
   sense when spacetime fluctuates, there are *non-local* observables
   that do.
   The basic idea is that certain spacetimes have regions which are
   protected from fluctuation, since it would take too much energy to
   wobble them.
   Sitting in this non-fluctuating part, we can attach an
   electron-detector lure to a fishing rod, and dangle it near the point
   $P$. The lure will fluctuate in position, but because I sit
   somewhere stable, the whole procedure is well-defined.
<!--   To paraphrase Archimedes, give me fishing rod long enough and place
   to sit, and I will measure spacetime.-->
  (These fishing-rod measurements are called *dressed observables* in
   the literature. There are other sorts of non-local observables, but
   I won't discuss them here.)
3. *Emergent spacetime.* I have somewhat understated the
   problem with microscopes. The formation of black holes is a
   picturesque way of saying that general relativity is *inconsistent*
   at high energies, and some new theory has to kick before we hit the
   Planck length. (We discuss this in the appendix.) The most promising candidate is [*string theory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory), which makes
   the remarkable prediction that spacetime is build out of tiny,
   vibrating strings. If they have a length $\ell_s \gtrsim
   \ell_P$, our microscopes will see them before we start making black
   holes.
   When spacetime materializes from some very different looking
   theory at high energies, we say it is *emergent.*
<!--   Although this is a consistent theory of quantum gravity, figuring
   out how to get our universe to emerge from string theory remains a
   difficult open problem. -->
4. *Fuzzy shapes.* In emergent theories, the macroscopic
  universe only appears as we zoom out from something fundamentally different.
  Alternatively, we can directly try to quantize the shape of
  spacetime, i.e. treat it as a fuzzy variable like the position of an
  electron.
  This is technically challenging since there many ways for space to look, but in 
  [*loop quantum gravity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity),
  the challenge is surmounted by discretising spacetime into
  graph-like structures called *spin networks*, whose edges are around
  a Planck-length long.
	 This is a very
   different way the theory can fail to make sense below the Planck
   scale. Look any closer, and you see nothing at all!

#### Appendix: quantum electrodynamics, gravitons and the Planck length

In this appendix, I'll explain why combining gravity and quantum
mechanics is not a problem until we hit the Planck scale. This is
slightly more advanced, which is why I've made it an appendix, but
note that we will be outrageously heuristic.
We'll start by discussing the quantum theory of electromagnetism,
called *quantum electrodynamics*.
We can then generalize to gravity, and see what works and what
doesn't.

##### Quantum electrodynamics

Suppose two electrons pass by each other.
Classically, they are repelled because each generates a field the
other responds to.
Quantum-mechanically, you cannot have action at a distance, and fields
are replaced by *messenger particles*, special particles whose
purpose is to mediate response to the field.
For electromagnetism, the messenger particle is a photon, so in order
to "feel" the repulsion, the electrons must throw some number of
photons back and forth.

Suppose there is some background probability $R$ for this repulsive
process to occur.
Given that it does, suppose the probability of exchange a photon is $\alpha$.
What's the probability of exchanging *any* number of photons?
Well, it's the probability repulsion occurs, times a sum of
probabilities, for all the different possibilities:

$$
P = R(\alpha + \alpha^2 + \alpha^3 + \cdots) = \frac{R\alpha}{1 - \alpha},
$$

where we used the geometric series to sum up all the $\alpha$ terms.
As long as $\alpha < 1$, this is well-behaved.
But if $\alpha = 1$, we are in trouble: the probability seems to be
infinite!
If the probabilities add up properly, we say the theory is *unitary*.
So, to check that quantum electrodynamics is unitary, we need to find
$\alpha$.

To estimate $\alpha$, we need to recall some facts about
electromagnetism.
Recall that *Couloumb's law* is

$$
F = \frac{k_e e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{r^2},
$$

where $k_e= 9\times 10^{9} \text{ N}\cdot \text{m}^2/\text{C}^2$
is the *Coulomb constant*.
The quantum-mechanical probability of undergoing an exchange process
in the first place depends on the separation $r$, but for our simple
model, we assume the number of photons exchanged does not.
Then the likelihood would seem to be governed by $k_e e^2$.
This is not a number.
To make it dimensionless, we use the technique of dimensional analysis
with fundamental constants: since quantum mechanics is involved we use
$\hbar$, and since photons are involved we use $c$.
The resulting guess is

$$
\alpha = \frac{k_e e^2}{\hbar c} \approx \frac{1}{137},
$$

a number called the *fine structure constant*.
It is smaller than $1$, so quantum electrodynamics appears to be
unitary.
Of course, we are making an extreme caricature of the theory, but the
general idea is the same.

##### Quantum gravity

Quantum gravity works the same way, but instead of the photon, the
messenger particle for gravity is called the *graviton*.
This theory is a bit more complicated than quantum electrodynamics,
but uses the same underlying formalism.
There is nothing mysterious about it!

Let's think about unitarity again.
Two massive particles that pass nearby have some probability of
interacting and exchange a number of gravitons.
If the probability to be attracted is $A$, and the probability of a
graviton exchange is $g$, then the same argument gives a rough
estimate

$$
P = A(g + g^2 + g^3 + \cdots) = \frac{Ag}{1-g}.
$$

Once again, we ask: what is $g$?
For particles of mass $M_1$ and $M_2$, Newton's law of gravitation is

$$
F = \frac{GM_1 M_2}{r^2}.
$$

Once again, to find $g$, we throw away the $r^2$, and divide by $\hbar
c$.
(Gravitons are massless and travel at the speed of light, just like
photons.)
Thus, we find that

$$
g = \frac{GM_1M_2}{\hbar c}.
$$

This looks very similar to the fine structure constant $\alpha$.
The subtlety lies in how we interpret the masses $M_1$ and $M_2$.
You might expect that $g$ is small if the particles have a small rest mass.
But here's the punchline: *gravity doesn't care about rest mass*.
It sees the *relativistic mass* $M = E/c^2$, which is the same argument we used
for photons and black holes above.
So, if we collide two particles of energy, each with relativistic mass
$M = E/c^2$, the probability of exchanging a single graviton is

$$
g = \frac{G E^2}{\hbar c^5}.
$$

If we crank up the energies until $g \approx 1$, then our nice theory
of quantum gravity as graviton exchange breaks down, i.e. it becomes
*non-unitary* and does not make sense.
This happens when

$$
g = \frac{G E^2}{\hbar c^5} \sim 1 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad E \sim
\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}} = E_P,
$$

where $E_P = \hbar c/\ell_P$ is the *Planck energy*, associated with
the Planck length we introduced above.
So, although quantum gravity makes perfect sense at low energies ---
it is just graviton exchange --- at the Planck scale, the theory
stops making sense.
Either new sorts of particles and exchange process appear to ensure
probability is conserved (as in string theory), or we have asked a
stupid question, and those energies make no sense (loop quantum gravity).
